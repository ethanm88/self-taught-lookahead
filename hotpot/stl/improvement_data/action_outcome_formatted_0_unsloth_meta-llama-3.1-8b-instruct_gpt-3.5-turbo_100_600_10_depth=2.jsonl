He was their only child to survive infancy. Styled Duke of Gloucester, he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the \"Glorious Revolution\" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather James II & VII the previous year.. Anne was estranged from her brother-in-law and cousin, William III & II, and her sister, Mary II, but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle William, who created him a Knight of the Garter, and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents.\nCurrent Action: search[monarchs of england]\nCurrent Observation: This list of kings and reigning queens of the Kingdom of England begins with Alfred the Great, who initially ruled Wessex, one of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which later made up modern England. Alfred styled himself king of the Anglo-Saxons from about 886, and while he was not the first king to claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the start of the first unbroken line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.[1]. Arguments are made for a few different kings thought to have controlled enough Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa of Mercia and Egbert of Wessex are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their wide dominions were part of a process leading to a unified England. The historian Simon Keynes states, for example, \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\"[2] That refers to a period in the late 8th century, when Offa achieved a dominance over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but it did not survive his death in 796.[3][4] Likewise, in 829 Egbert of Wessex conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it..\nPossible Next Actions: search[prince philip, duke of edinburgh], search[england], search[kingdom of england], finish[england]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: finish[england]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Terminal State\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The question asks for the kingdom that Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, and Prince George of Denmark were eventually monarchs of.

He was the consort of the British monarch from Anne's accession on 8 March 1702 until his death in 1708.. The marriage of George and Anne was arranged in the early 1680s with a view to developing an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain Dutch maritime power. As a result, George was disliked by his Dutch brother-in-law, William\u00a0III, Prince of Orange, who was married to Anne's elder sister, Mary.

Lansing is probably best remembered as the authoritarian Brigadier General Frank Savage in 12 O'Clock High (1964), the television drama series about American bomber pilots during World War II.[2][4] During his career, which spanned five decades, Lansing appeared in 245 episodes of 73 television series, 11 TV movies, and 19 motion pictures.[citation needed] His other notable television roles included 87th Precinct (1961\u201362), Automan (1983\u20131984), and The Equalizer (1985\u20131989).. While living in Los Angeles, California, he attended University High School.[5] As a young actor in New York City, he was hired to join a stock company in Michigan, but was told he would first have to join the Actors' Equity Association. Equity would not allow him to join as \"Robert Brown\" because another actor was using that name. Because the stock company was based in Lansing, this became the actor's new surname.[6].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for Robert Lansing provides background information about the actor. Specifically, it mentions that his surname was changed to Lansing because another actor was already using the name Robert Brown.

Travers Humphreys was born in Doughty Street in Bloomsbury in London, the fourth son and sixth child of solicitor Charles Octavius Humphreys, and his wife, Harriet Ann (n\u00e9e Grain), the sister of the entertainer Richard Corney Grain. Humphreys was educated at Shrewsbury School and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1889.[1] He was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple in 1889 and entered the chambers of Edward Thomas Edmonds Besley (1826-1901), where he concentrated on practice in the criminal courts.. On 1 March 1895 Oscar Wilde, Lord Alfred Douglas and Robbie Ross approached Charles Octavius Humphreys with the intention of suing the Marquess of Queensberry, Douglas' father, for criminal libel.

According to Anglo-Saxon legends recounted in Widsith and other sources such as \u00c6thelweard (Chronicon), their earliest named ancestor was a culture-hero named Sceaf, who was washed ashore as a child in an empty boat, bearing a sheaf of corn. This is said to have occurred on an island named Scani or Scandza (Scania), and according to William of Malmesbury (Gesta regum Anglorum) he was later chosen as King of the Angles, reigning from Schleswig.

Claiming to have been established in the 1960s, it rose to public recognition in the early 1980s, attracting attention for its neo-Nazi ideology and activism. Describing its approach as \"Traditional Satanism\", it also exhibits Hermetic and modern Pagan elements in its beliefs.. According to the Order's own claims, it was established in the Welsh Marches of Western England during the late 1960s by a woman who had previously been involved in a secretive pre-Christian sect which survived in the region. This account also states that in 1973, a man named \"Anton Long\" was initiated into the group, subsequently becoming its grand master.\nPossible Next Actions: search[christianisation of anglo-saxon england]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[christianisation of anglo-saxon england]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England was the process starting in the late 6th century by which population of England formerly adhering to the Anglo-Saxon, and later Nordic, forms of Germanic paganism converted to Christianity and adopted Christian worldviews.. The process of Christianisation and timing of the adoption of Christianity varied by region and was not necessarily a one-way process, with the traditional religion regaining dominance in most kingdoms at least once after their first Christian king. Kings likely often converted for political reasons such as the imposition by a more powerful king, to gain legitimacy, and to access book-writing traditions; however, there were also significant drawbacks to the conversion that may explain the reluctance of many kings to be baptised.. The first major step was the Gregorian mission that landed in the Kingdom of Kent in 597, and within the Heptarchy, \u00c6thelberht of Kent became the first Anglo-Saxon king to be baptised, around 600. He in turn imposed Christianity on Saebert of Essex and R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for the Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England provides the information that both \"Beowulf\" and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" preserve a legendary list of the kings of the Angles after their conversion to Christianity.

West Saxon was the language of the kingdom of Wessex, and was the basis for successive widely used literary forms of Old English: the Early West Saxon of Alfred the Great's time, and the Late West Saxon of the late 10th and 11th centuries. Due to the Saxons' establishment as a politically dominant force in the Old English period, the West Saxon dialects became the strongest dialects in Old English manuscript writing.[1].

According to these historians, who take a critical view of Rommel, such depictions are not accurate.. The description of Rommel as a brilliant commander started in 1941, with Rommel's participation, as a component of Nazi propaganda to praise the Wehrmacht and instill optimism in the German public. It was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British war-time press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa: the genius of Rommel was used by dissenters to protest against social inequality within the British Army and by leaders like Churchill to reduce class tensions.[n 1].

Centers of gravity can be physical, moral, or both, and exist for all belligerents at all tactical, strategic, and operational levels of war simultaneously.[1] COGs play a central role in military planning, though exact definition has been elusive, with interpretations varying substantially over time, across forces, and between theorists. Generally, a COG can be thought of as an essential part of a combatant's warfighting system, interference with which would result in disproportionate impact on their combat effectiveness.[2]:\u200a60\u201364\u200a[3]:\u200a1041.

It was published in February 1988, in a limited run of 2500 copies, by Genesis Publications, and included an EP of rare or previously unreleased Harrison recordings. Intended as a luxury item, each copy was hand-bound and boxed, and available only by direct order through Genesis in England. The book contains the lyrics to 60 Harrison compositions, the themes of which West represents visually with watercolour paintings. Starting in 1985, Harrison and West worked on the project for two years, during which Harrison returned to music-making with his album Cloud Nine, after focusing on film production for much of the early 1980s.\nPossible Next Actions: search[harrison ford filmography], search[gary clark jr.]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[gary clark jr.]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Gary Lee Clark Jr.[1] (born February 15, 1984) is an American guitarist and singer who fuses blues, rock and soul music with elements of hip hop.[2] In 2011, Clark signed with Warner Bros Records and released The Bright Lights EP.[3] It was followed by the albums Blak and Blu (2012) and The Story of Sonny Boy Slim (2015).

This narrow area was formed by the James lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last ice age, and as a consequence the watershed of the river is slender and it has few major tributaries for a river of its length.. The James drops approximately 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) per 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km), and this low gradient sometimes leads to reverse flow. Reverse flow occurs when high inflow from tributaries leads to James River water flowing upstream for several miles above the joining water.\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of longest rivers of the united states]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of longest rivers of the united states]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Download coordinates as:.

The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the US Department of Defense to oversee development. Advanced weapon concepts, including lasers,[4][5] particle-beam weapons, and ground and space-based missile systems were studied, along with sensor, command and control, and computer systems needed to control a system consisting of hundreds of combat centers and satellites spanning the globe.

An ice dune is produced by ice washing ashore, snowfall, and the gradual freezing of wave spray that accumulates on to the shore.[2] They form when the air temperature is below freezing and the water temperature is near freezing.[2] Ice dunes are commonly at least six feet (1.8\u00a0m) tall, but the dune's size depends on the beach and the weather.[2] The tidal range, the storminess of the water and the topography of the beach all can affect the size of the dunes.[3] The dunes will also stop forming if the body of the water they border freezes over, which often happens on Lake Erie.[2] Ice dunes will usually break up in the early stages of spring thaw.. Ice dunes are important in formations, such as sandspits and sand isthmuses, that could be eroded by wave action. An example of a Great Lakes sandspit is Presque Isle State Park in Erie, Pennsylvania.[2] When the dunes form, they form a barrier between the waves and the shore and prevent the waves from reaching the shore, keeping the sand in place.. Because of the way ice dunes form, they are inherently weak and filled with cracks and air pockets.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for ice dune provides the crucial link to Presque Isle State Park by stating it's an example of a Great Lakes sandspit formed by wave action. However, this is still background level as it doesn't mention the specific 3,112 acres, the 11,000 working hours or Presque Isle's recorded history to form besides referencing wave action indirectly.

Despite the stereotypes surrounding feminism and the dominant social narratives surrounding feminism during their time, women like Zora Neale Hurston and Emma Goldman argued that by using philosophical ideas of aesthetics and ideas of femininity, it is possible to empower and analyze the ways that gender works in everyday life.

Based on his fascination with spirituality, Aykroyd conceived Ghostbusters as a project starring himself and John Belushi, in which they would venture through time and space battling supernatural threats.

They have agreed by the treaties to share their own sovereignty through the institutions of the European Union in certain aspects of government. State governments must agree unanimously in the Council for the union to adopt some policies; for others, collective decisions are made by qualified majority voting. These obligations and sharing of sovereignty within the EU (sometimes referred to as supranational) make it unique among international organisations, as it has established its own legal order which by the provisions of the founding treaties is both legally binding and supreme on all the member states (after a landmark ruling of the ECJ in 1964). A founding principle of the union is subsidiarity, meaning that decisions are taken collectively if and only if they cannot realistically be taken individually..\nCurrent Action: search[u.s. state]\nCurrent Observation: In the United States, a state is a constituent political entity, of which there are 50. Bound together in a political union, each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a separate and defined geographic territory where it shares its sovereignty with the federal government. Due to this shared sovereignty, Americans are citizens both of the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.[3] State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons restricted by certain types of court orders (such as paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who share child custody).. State governments in the U.S. are allocated power by the people (of each respective state) through their individual state constitutions.\nPossible Next Actions: search[flag of europe]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[flag of europe]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The flag of Europe or European flag[note 1] consists of twelve golden stars forming a circle on a blue field.

Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions.. A city can be defined by its administrative boundaries, otherwise known as city proper. UNICEF defines city proper as, \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government.[1][2][3] Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.[4]. The use of city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives.[4] Because of this definition, the city proper population figure may differ greatly from the urban area population figure, as many cities are amalgamations of smaller municipalities (Australia), and conversely, many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the core urban area into suburban and rural areas.[5] The Chinese municipality of Chongqing, which is the largest city proper in the world by population, comprises a huge administrative area of 82,403\u00a0km2, around the size of Austria.\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of largest cities in the united states]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of largest cities in the united states]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Download coordinates as:.

The most remarkable period of historical writing, dubbed as the 'Golden Age' of medieval English historiography,[1][2] was during the High Middle Ages in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when English chronicles produced works with a variety of interest, wealth of information and amplitude of range. However one might choose to view the reliability or nature of particular works, it is from these that much of our knowledge of the Middle Ages originates.. Prior to the boom in historical writing in the High Middle Ages, the number and quality of works from England's earlier period is often lacking, with some notable and bright exceptions. Later historians lamented the gaps in this period and usually explained it by way of Viking invasions; in the twelfth century William of Malmesbury said: \"in many places in England that knowledge of the deeds of the saints has been wiped out, in my opinion by the violence of enemies\".[3].\nPossible Next Actions: search[john hamer]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[john hamer]\nObservation of Best Successor State: John Hamer is the name of:.

The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a global center of finance[12] and commerce, culture, technology,[13] entertainment and media, academics and scientific output,[14] the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy.[15][16][17][18][19].

Biological pest control methods such as the fostering of insect predators are also encouraged.[6] Organic agriculture can be defined as \"an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity while, with rare exceptions, prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones\".[7][8][9][10] It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Certified organic agriculture accounted for 70\u00a0million hectares (170\u00a0million acres) globally in 2019, with over half of that total in Australia.[11]. Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or severely limiting synthetic substances.[12] For instance, naturally occurring pesticides, such as garlic extract, bicarbonate of soda, or pyrethrin (which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower), are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, such as glyphosate, are prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed only in exceptional circumstances may include copper sulfate, elemental sulfur, and veterinary drugs.\nCurrent Action: search[2022 united states house of representatives elections in michigan]\nCurrent Observation: The 2022 United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan were held on November 8, 2022, to elect representatives for the thirteen seats in Michigan (reduced from 14 in the redistricting cycle following the 2020 United States census). The deadline for candidates to file for the August 2 primary was April 19.[1] The congressional makeup prior to the election was seven Democrats and seven Republicans. However, after the 2020 census, Michigan lost one congressional seat. Democrats won a majority of seats in the state for the first time since 2008.[a] This can be partly attributed to the decrease in the number of districts, which resulted in two Republican incumbents \u2013 Bill Huizenga and Fred Upton \u2013 in the new 4th district.[2] Redistricting also played a part in shifting partisan lean of the districts which favored the Democrats overall, including in the 3rd district, which Democrats were able to flip with a margin of victory of 13 points.[3] That was made possible by a non-partisan citizens' commission drawing the new political boundaries instead of the Michigan legislature after a 2018 ballot proposal was approved.[4]. The 1st district covers the Upper Peninsula and the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, including Traverse City.\nPossible Next Actions: search[farmers' markets in new york city], search[list of people from bennington, vermont], search[speaker of the united states house of representatives]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[farmers' markets in new york city]\nObservation of Best Successor State: There are over 50 farmer's markets in New York City in all boroughs, which operate under GrowNYC under the \"Greenmarket\" name.[1] GrowNYC's food hub, \"Greenmarket\", includes Greenmarket Co., Youthmarket, Fresh Food Box, and the Wholesale Greenmarket under its programming.[2] Greenmarket farmers market aims to encourage regional agriculture by allowing small family farms to sell their locally grown fruits, vegetables, flowers, dairy and other products, so that people in New York of all incomes and in all parts, have access to the fresh, nutritious, provincial, affordable and sustainable goods.[3].

He was also awarded the Eddington Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1969.[5][6][7]. Hewish attended King's College, Taunton.[8] His undergraduate degree, at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, was interrupted by the Second World War. He was assigned to war service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and at the Telecommunications Research Establishment where he worked with Martin Ryle.[9] Returning to the University of Cambridge in 1946, Hewish completed his undergraduate degree and became a postgraduate student in Ryle's research team at the Cavendish Laboratory.[8] For his PhD thesis, awarded in 1952, Hewish made practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the scintillations of astronomical radio sources, due to foreground plasma.[10]. Hewish proposed the construction of a large phased array radio telescope, which could be used to perform a survey at high time resolution, primarily for studying interplanetary scintillation.[8] In 1965 he secured funding to construct his design, the Interplanetary Scintillation Array, at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) outside Cambridge.[8] It was completed in 1967.\nCurrent Action: search[kardashev scale]\nCurrent Observation: The Kardashev scale (Russian: \u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0448\u0451\u0432\u0430, romanized:\u00a0shkala Kardashyova) is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is capable of harnessing and using.

The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches.[3][4] The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877;[5] since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 13 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.[6]. Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics.[7] This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.. As of July\u00a02024[update], the most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 414 of their 866 Tests (47.80%).\nPossible Next Actions: search[test cricket records], search[england cricket team]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[england cricket team]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The England men's cricket team represents  England and Wales in international cricket.

Alexander the Great conquered Persian-controlled Egypt in 332 BC during his campaigns against the Achaemenid Empire. His death in 323 BC was followed by the rapid unraveling of the Macedonian Empire amid competing claims by the diadochi, his closest friends and companions.

After the Macedonian conquest of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC and its disintegration shortly thereafter in the Partition of Babylon and subsequent Wars of the Diadochi, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout West Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), Northeast Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom).[5][6] This resulted in an influx of Greek colonists and the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms, a breadth spanning as far as modern-day India. These new Greek kingdoms were also influenced by regional indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where deemed beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the ancient Greek world with that of the Western Asian, Northeastern African, and Southwestern Asian worlds.[7] The consequence of this mixture gave rise to a common Attic-based Greek dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca throughout the ancient world.. During the Hellenistic period, Greek cultural influence reached its peak in the Mediterranean and beyond.\nPossible Next Actions: search[145 bc], search[hellenistic sculpture], search[han dynasty]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[hellenistic sculpture]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Hellenistic sculpture represents one of the most important expressions of Hellenistic culture, and the final stage in the evolution of Ancient Greek sculpture. The definition of its chronological duration, as well as its characteristics and meaning, have been the subject of much discussion among art historians, and it seems that a consensus is far from being reached.[1] The Hellenistic period is usually considered to comprise the interval between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, and the conquest of Egypt by the Romans in 30 BC.[2] Its generic characteristics are defined by eclecticism, secularism, and historicism, building on the heritage of classical Greek sculpture and assimilating Eastern influences.[3]. Among his original contributions to the Greek tradition of sculpture were the development of new techniques, the refinement of the representation of human anatomy and emotional expression, and a change in the goals and approaches to art, abandoning the generic for the specific. This translated into the abandonment of the classical idealism of an ethical and pedagogical character in exchange for an emphasis on everyday human aspects and the directing of production toward purely aesthetic and, occasionally, propagandistic ends. The attention paid to man and his inner life, his emotions, his common problems and longings, resulted in a realist style that tended to reinforce the dramatic, the prosaic, and the moving, and with this appeared the first individualized and verisimilitude portraits in Western art.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for Hellenistic sculpture provides information about the chronological duration of the Hellenistic period.

Indeed, several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, making it difficult to reconcile the results of different studies.[1][2][3] However, most definitions include a psychological component (such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire) and/or a behavioural component (which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s).

A reduced kingdom continued to exist after Almoravid rule ended, and the kingdom was later incorporated into subsequent Sahelian empires, such as the Mali Empire.[4] Around the same time, south of the Mali empire in present-day northern Ghana, the Kingdom of Dagbon emerged.[5] The decentralised states ruled by the tindaamba were unified into a kingdom.[6][7] Many sub-kingdoms would later arise from Dagbon including the Mossi Kingdoms[8] of Burkina Faso[9] and Bouna Kingdom[10] of Ivory Coast.[11] Dagbon pioneered Ghana's earliest learning institutions,[12] including a university town,[13] and a writing system prior to European arrival.[14]. Toward the end of the classical era, larger regional kingdoms had formed in West Africa, one of which was the Kingdom of Ghana, north of what is today the nation of Ghana. Before its fall at the beginning of the 10th century, Akans migrated southward and founded several nation-states around their matriclans, including the first empire of Bono state founded in the 11th century and for which the Brong-Ahafo (Bono Ahafo) region is named.[15] The Mole-Dagbon people, who founded the earliest centralised political kingdoms of Ghana, migrated from Lake Chad to present-day Ghana. Later, Akan ethnic groups such as the Ashanti, Akwamu, Akyem, Fante state and others are thought to possibly have roots in the original Bono state settlement at Bono Manso.[16] The Ashanti kingdom's government operated first as a loose network and eventually as a centralized empire-kingdom with an advanced, highly specialized bureaucracy centred on the capital Kumasi.[17].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for the history of Ghana provides only background information about the history of Ghana and does not directly contribute to finding the all female high school in a town in Sunyani West District in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana.

When compared to other countries, South Africa has notably high rates of violent crime[6] and has a reputation for consistently having one of the highest murder rates in the world.[7][8][9] The country also experiences high rates of organised crime relative to other countries.[10][11]. Crime levels have been attributed to poverty, problems with delivery of public services, and wealth disparity.[12] The Institute for Security Studies also highlighted factors beyond poverty and inequality, particularly social stress from uncaring environments in early childhood[13] and subsequent lack of guardianship. South Africa's high crime rates, recidivism and overburdened criminal justice system have been described as a crisis[14] which will require a radical rethink of crime and punishment in young people.[15][16].

Data with many entries (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[1]. Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[2] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data.[3] Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4].\nPossible Next Actions: search[ariana grande discography]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[ariana grande discography]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The American singer, songwriter, and actress Ariana Grande has released seven studio albums, one soundtrack album, one live album, one remix album, one compilation album, two extended plays (EPs), sixty singles (including seventeen as a featured artist), and fourteen promotional singles.

Both have fields that are 400 feet (120\u00a0m) or more in diameter between their furthest endpoints,[1] offensive players who can hit a thrown/\"bowled\" ball out of the field and run between safe areas to score runs (points) at the risk of being gotten out (forced off the field of play by the opposing team and thus left unable to score further runs during that play), and have a major game format lasting about 3 hours.[citation needed]. Despite their similarities, the two sports also have many differences in play and in strategy; for example, far more runs are scored in a cricket match compared to a baseball game.[2] A comparison between baseball and cricket can be instructive to followers of either sport, since the differences help to highlight nuances particular to each game.. Bat-and-ball games, in general, are sports in which one team (the fielding team) has possession of the ball and delivers it to a member of the other team (the batting team), who tries to hit it. The two opposing teams take turns playing these two distinct roles, which are continuous during a specified interval.[3].\nPossible Next Actions: search[willie davis (defensive end)], search[william \"wee willie\" davis]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[william \"wee willie\" davis]\nObservation of Best Successor State: William Grundy \"Wee Willie\" Davis (December 7, 1906 \u2013 April 9, 1981) was an American film actor and professional wrestler.[1][2][3][4] He was born in New York City and died in Louisville, Kentucky, aged 74..

It included equality in employment, enlisting in the military, freedom to worship and allowing churches to address their own finances and  several matters with their followers.[1] The decree was part of the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 which sought to address inequalities between Muslim and non-Muslim citizens, mainly affecting the Coptic Christian minority.[2] The law mandated that the Ottoman Sultan must issue permits for any construction or maintenance of churches, and the Coptic Pope had to apply for all such permits.[1] After the end of Ottoman rule, only the king, and then the President of Egypt could issue these permits, although in 1999, under the administration of Hosni Mubarak, the law was changed to also allow Egyptian Governors to grant permits.[3] The decree is often confused with the 1934 Ten Conditions of Al-Ezabi,[4] which enlarged the restrictions and added ten limiting conditions.[5] Although the original decree amended a ban on the construction of Coptic churches, today it is the subject of controversies over religious freedom.[6]. While ostensibly part of the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire in the 1800s, the special restrictions on churches trace back to the Pact of Umar in the 7th century.

In turn, Handel's music forms one of the peaks of the \"high baroque\" style, bringing Italian opera to its highest development, creating the genres of English oratorio and organ concerto, and introducing a new style into English church music. He is consistently recognized as one of the greatest composers of his age.[6][7].

A love\u2013hate relationship has been linked to the occurrence of emotional ambivalence in early childhood;[5] to conflicting responses by different ego states within the same person;[6] or to the inevitable co-existence of egoistic conflicts with the object of love.[7]. Individuals with Narcissistic personality disorder or Borderline personality disorder have been seen as particularly prone to aggressive reactions towards love objects,[8] not least when issues of self-identity are involved:[9] in extreme instances, hate at the very existence of the other may be the only emotion felt, until love breaks through behind it.[10].

It is the primary centre-left party in Japan,[13][14] and as of 2024 is the second largest party in the National Diet behind the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).[15]. It was founded in October 2017 as a split from the Democratic Party ahead of the 2017 general election.[13] In late 2020, the party was re-founded following a merger with majorities of the Democratic Party For the People and the Social Democratic Party as well as some independent lawmakers.. The party's platform supports raising the minimum wage, expanded welfare policies, the legalization of same-sex marriage, increased gender equality,[16] renewable energy policies, decentralization, a multilateral foreign policy, the revision of the U.S.\u2013Japan Status of Forces Agreement, tax reform and electoral reform.[17] The party strongly opposes efforts to amend the Japanese Constitution to reinterpret Article 9 or codify the status of the Japan Self-Defense Forces and also opposes nuclear power.. The party was formed in the run up to the 2017 general election from a split of the centre-left wing of the opposition Democratic Party (DP).[18][19][20][21] Prior to the election on 28 September 2017, the DP House of Representatives caucus dissolved in order for party members to stand as candidates for Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike's Party of Hope or as independents in the upcoming election.[22].\nPossible Next Actions: search[democratic party of canada], search[social democratic party (uk)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[democratic party of canada]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Democratic Party of Canada was a short-lived political party in Canada..

Using the card thus accrues debt that has to be repaid later.[1] Credit cards are one of the most widely used forms of payment across the world.[2]. A regular credit card differs from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month, or at the end of each statement cycle.[3] In contrast, credit cards allow consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged at a specific rate. A credit card also differs from a charge card in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller, and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.[citation needed] A credit card also differs from a debit card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card.. As of June 2018,[update] there were 7.753 billion credit cards in the world.[4] In 2020, there were 1.09 billion credit cards in circulation in the United States, and 72.5% of adults (187.3 million) in the country had at least one credit card.[5][6][7][8].\nCurrent Action: search[punched card]\nCurrent Observation: A punched card (also punch card[1] or punched-card[2]) is a stiff paper-based medium used to store digital information via the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions.

Early applications included controlling weaving looms and recording census data. In the 20th century, they became central to business operations and early computers for input, output, and storage.

Cards in CCGs are specially designed sets of playing cards. Each card represents an element of the theme and rules of the game, and each can fall in categories such as creatures, enhancements, events, resources, and locations.[3] All cards within the CCG typically share the same common backside art, while the front has a combination of proprietary artwork or images to embellish the card along with instructions for the game and flavor text.[4] CCGs are typically themed around fantasy or science fiction genres, and have also included horror themes, cartoons, and sports, and may include licensed intellectual properties.[3]. Generally, a player will begin playing a CCG with a pre-made starter deck, then later customize their deck with cards they acquire from semi-random booster packs or trade with other players.[5] As a player obtains more cards, they may create new decks from scratch using the cards in their collection.

The date has not been considered dangerous by law enforcement agencies and the notion that it is an annual date when people engage in child molestation has been questioned.[8] According to Jesse Bach, a former director of the Imagine Foundation, an organization that develops research and recovery for sex-trafficking victims, Alice Day is a real phenomenon, but instances of child sexual abuse can occur at any date.[2][9] Alice Day falls in the middle of the child abuse awareness month.[3][6] According to Snopes, the event was first conceptualized on internet forums, but is not widely celebrated by child molesters every year.[1].

In the scene, Mark Antony is alone with Julius Caesar's body, shortly after Caesar's assassination. In a soliloquy, he reveals his intention to incite the crowd at Caesar's funeral to rise up against the assassins. Foreseeing violence throughout Rome, Antony even imagines Caesar's spirit joining in the exhortations: \"raging for revenge, with Ate by his side come hot from hell, shall in these confines with a Monarch's voice cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war.\"[1]. In a literal reading, \"dogs\" are the familiar animals, trained for warfare; \"havoc\" is a military order permitting the seizure of spoil after a victory; and \"let slip\" is to release from the leash.[2][3][4] Shakespeare's source for Julius Caesar was The Life of Marcus Brutus from Plutarch's Lives, and the concept of the war dog appears in that work, in the section devoted to the Greek warrior Aratus.[5][6].\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of proverbial phrases], search[gospel of thomas], search[25 april]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of proverbial phrases]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Below is an alphabetical list of widely used and repeated proverbial phrases.

For many long-attested or well-known palindromes, authorship can not be determined, although a number can tentatively be attributed to a handful of prolific palindrome creators.[2] Because of the popularity of palindromes as a form of word play, a number of sources have collected and listed popular palindromes,[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] and palindrome-constructing contests have been held.[9][10].

Every year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate draft, known as the NFL draft.[5][6] The Chargers took part in the rival AFL draft for the first seven years of their existence, meaning that they had to compete for new players' signatures with whichever club had picked them in the NFL draft.[7] Their first draft selection was Monty Stickles, an end from the University of Notre Dame.[8] Unlike all future picks, he was not chosen by the Chargers themselves, but rather assigned in a territorial draft at a meeting of the AFL's original owners.[9] Stickles never played for the Chargers as he chose to sign for the San Francisco 49ers instead; overall, the Chargers were unable to sign their first-round selection four times during their first seven years. After that, the two leagues conducted a common draft, ending the inter-league bidding war.[4] Over a decade later, the original United States Football League (USFL) challenged the NFL by conducting its own collegiate drafts from 1983 to 1986.[10][11] The Chargers temporarily lost two of their first-round picks (Gary Anderson and Mossy Cade) to USFL clubs, though both joined the NFL in 1985 as the USFL struggled financially.[12]. In the NFL draft, teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on.[5] Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, or a combination thereof.[5] Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.[5] The Chargers have been without a first-round pick eight times in their history, including six times in seven years from 1994 to 2000.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for list of Los Angeles Chargers first-round draft picks provides the information that the Colts' first ever draft pick was a halfback who won the Heisman Trophy.

Rochester was described by his contemporary Andrew Marvell as \"the best English satirist\", and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits.[5] His poetry was widely censored during the Victorian era, but enjoyed a revival from the 1920s onwards, with reappraisals from noted literary figures such as Graham Greene and Ezra Pound.[6] The critic Vivian de Sola Pinto linked Rochester's libertinism to Hobbesian materialism.[6]. During his lifetime Rochester was best known for A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind and it remains among his best-known works today.. John Wilmot was born at Ditchley House in Oxfordshire on 1 April 1647.

The chant is believed to have been created in the 1960s, after England had won the World Cup against West Germany.[4] It was created by England fans to reflect on England's historic achievements.[5] In 2006, Market traders in Leicester were banned from selling T-shirts with \"Two World Wars, 1 World Cup\" on them by Leicester City Council amid fears that the shirts \"could cause offence\".[6] Before the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office attempted to dissuade England fans from singing \"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" while in Germany.[2] Despite these attempts, the chant was widely used by England fans whilst in Germany.[7]. The chant has been criticised as \"jingoistic\", although a number of England supporters feel they are justified in singing it against Germany.[8] However, it has been praised in some foreign media with one Australian commentator stating envy of England fans for being able to use it during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[9] A Canadian reporter also said that the chant reflected \"a deeply historic sense of national honour\".[10]  During the 2010 FIFA World Cup South African communications company, MTN Group ran a television advertisement on South African television involving the chant.[11]. \"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" is also the name of an episode of the BBC documentary Everyman.[12].

The Axis were united in their far-right positions and general opposition to the Allies, but otherwise lacked comparable coordination and ideological cohesion.. The Axis grew out of successive diplomatic efforts by Germany, Italy, and Japan to secure their own specific expansionist interests in the mid-1930s. The first step was the protocol signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936, after which Italian leader Benito Mussolini declared that all other European countries would thereafter rotate on the Rome\u2013Berlin axis, thus creating the term \"Axis\".[2] The following November saw the ratification of the Anti-Comintern Pact, an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan; Italy joined the Pact in 1937, followed by Hungary and Spain in 1939.\nPossible Next Actions: search[allies], search[allied war crimes during world war ii], search[united states navy in world war ii]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[united states navy in world war ii]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The United States Navy grew rapidly during its involvement in World War II from 1941\u201345, and played a central role in the Pacific War against Imperial Japan.

They became the flagship band for the Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records and its nightclub, The Ha\u00e7ienda. They worked in long-term collaboration with graphic designer Peter Saville on their album covers.[3].

Clooney ultimately directed Suburbicon himself, with a script rewritten by Grant Heslov to take place in 1957.[6].\nPossible Next Actions: search[coen brothers filmography], search[it (2017 film)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[it (2017 film)]\nObservation of Best Successor State: It (titled onscreen as It Chapter One) is a 2017 American supernatural horror film directed by Andy Muschietti and written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman.

Seventeen songs appeared on the tape, ten of which appeared on Nebraska, while others appeared in full-band renditions on the follow-up album Born in the U.S.A. (1984) and as B-sides..

The genre is exemplified by singer-songwriters Tom Petty, Bob Seger, Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Michael Stanley, and John Mellencamp and country music artists, including Steve Earle and Joe Ely.[1] The genre developed in the 1970s and reached its commercial peak in the 1980s when it became one of the best-selling genres in the United States. In the 1990s, many established acts faded and the genre began to fragment, but the major figures have continued to record with commercial success.. The term heartland rock was not coined to describe a clear genre until the 1980s.[2] In terms of style, it often uses straightforward rock music, sometimes with elements of Americana with a basic rhythm and blues line-up of drums, keyboards and occasional horn section instruments like a saxophone. However, this common definition may represent an oversimplification given that Bruce Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A.\nPossible Next Actions: search[born to run (album)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[born to run (album)]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Born to Run is the third studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on August 25, 1975, by Columbia Records.

Originally a realm of the Farnese family after Pope Paul III made it a hereditary duchy for his son, Pier Luigi Farnese, it was ruled by the dynasty until 1731, when the last duke, Antonio Farnese, died without direct heirs.[1][2] After a decade of Habsburg rule, the duchy passed to the House of Bourbon-Parma.. It was invaded by Napoleon and annexed by France, having its sovereignty restored in 1814 after Napoleon's defeat. Napoleon's wife, Marie Louise (Maria Luigia), then ruled as its duchess until her death. Parma was restored to Bourbon rule in 1847, and in 1859, the duchy was formally abolished as it was integrated into the new Italian state.[1].\nPossible Next Actions: search[regions of italy]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[regions of italy]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The regions of Italy (Italian: regioni d'Italia) are the first-level administrative divisions of the Italian Republic, constituting its second NUTS administrative level.[1] There are twenty regions, five of which are autonomous regions with special status.

It has its origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and modern India, especially in the aftermath of the collapse of the Mughal Empire and the establishment of the British Raj.[1][2][3][4]. Beginning in ancient India, the caste system was originally centered around varna, with Brahmins (priests) and, to a lesser extent, Kshatriyas (rulers and warriors) serving as the elite classes, followed by Vaishyas (traders, merchants, and farmers) and finally Shudras (labourers). Outside of this system are the oppressed, marginalised, and persecuted Dalits (also known as \"Untouchables\") and Adivasis (tribals).[5][6] Over time, the system became increasingly rigid, and the emergence of jati led to further entrenchment, introducing thousands of new castes and sub-castes.[7] With the arrival of Islamic rule, caste distinctions formulated in Muslim communities, across the subcontinent, as well.[1][8][9] The British Raj furthered the system, through census classifications and preferential treatment to Christians and people belonging to certain castes.[8] Social unrest during the 1920s led to a change in this policy towards affirmative action.[10][11][12] Today, there are around 3,000 castes and 25,000 sub-castes in India.[13]. Caste-based differences have also been practised in other regions and religions in the Indian subcontinent, like Nepalese Buddhism,[14] Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism.[15] It has been challenged by many reformist Hindu movements,[16] Buddhism, Sikhism, Christianity,[15] and present-day Neo Buddhism.[17] With Indian influences, the caste system is also practiced in Bali.[18].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for the caste system in India is completely irrelevant to the question being asked about the English actor from the film \"The System\". \nThus the correctness score is 1.40 / 10.00."}], [{"from": "human", "value": "Determine the value / correctness score (1 - 10) of the current state.\nYou must provide the best next action and the observation (in the same format as the current observation) for this best successor state.

As of the 2020 census, the city's population of 67,047 made it the state's ninth-most populous city and the twenty-fifth most-populous municipality.[4] The city is in eastern New York, near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. It is in the same metropolitan area as the state capital, Albany, which is about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) southeast.[5]. Schenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many of whom came from the Albany area.

This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on BBC Radio 1 at lunchtime and later published in Music Week.[1] On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100[2] and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data collection process.[1][2] The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.[3]. During the 1980s there were a total of 191 singles which took the UK chart number 1 spot.[4] In terms of number-one singles, Madonna was the most successful single act of the decade, as six of her singles reached the top spot.

The generation has been described as the generation that removed all \"stock\" aspects from stock car racing and was as aerodynamically sensitive as a Le Mans Prototype.[2]. Generation 4 cars feature highly modified bodies with teams spending hours in the wind tunnel to gain aerodynamics.[3]  The bumpers, nose and tail are composed of molded fiberglass based on production counterparts.[3][1] In the 2000s teams began using different RPM levels on their engines making each team and manufacturer sound different.[4]. In 1992, the Gen 4 car arrived at the sport when steel bodies became primarily custom made instead of using stock pieces, and wind tunnels became a staple as teams worked to gain aerodynamics.[5] At racing speeds approaching 200 miles per hour, a modern NASCAR race car can generate enough lift to get airborne if it spins sideways. To keep cars firmly planted, roof flaps were required in 1994.[3].\nCurrent Action: search[2006 nascar craftsman truck series]\nCurrent Observation: The 2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series was the twelfth season of the Craftsman Truck Series, the third highest stock car racing series sanctioned by NASCAR in the United States.

When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases.[3]. The primary form of fMRI uses the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast,[4] discovered by Seiji Ogawa in 1990. This is a type of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells.[4] Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate brain mapping research because it does not involve the use of injections, surgery, the ingestion of substances, or exposure to ionizing radiation.[5] This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied.\nPossible Next Actions: search[magnetic resonance neurography], search[magnetic resonance angiography]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[magnetic resonance neurography]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is the direct imaging of nerves in the body by optimizing selectivity for unique MRI water properties of nerves.

The significant difference is their series run length; telenovelas tell one self-contained story, typically within the span of a year or less whereas soap operas tend to have intertwined storylines told during indefinite, continuing runs.[3][4] This makes them shorter than most other television series, but still much longer than a miniseries. This planned run results in a faster-paced, more concise style of melodrama compared to a typical soap opera.[5] Episodes of telenovelas usually last between 30 and 45 minutes, and rarely more than an hour, except for final episodes.

Popol Vuh began as an electronic music project, but under Fricke's leadership they soon abandoned synthesizers for organic instrumentation and world music influences.[5] They developed a productive working partnership with director Werner Herzog, contributing scores to films such as Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), and Fitzcarraldo (1982).[5] The group are associated with West Germany's 1970s krautrock movement and are considered progenitors of new-age and ambient music.[5] Pitchfork magazine called Hosianna Mantra (1972) Popol Vuh's classic release.[6]. The band's name, taken from the Mayan manuscript, has been translated roughly as \"meeting place\"[2] or \"book of the community\".[3] Their first album, Affenstunde, released in 1970, can be regarded as one of the earliest space music works,[citation needed] featuring the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer (rare sight in Germany of early 70s)[7] together with ethnic percussion.[citation needed] This continued for only one more album, In den G\u00e4rten Pharaos, and material later to be released on the soundtrack to Aguirre, the Wrath of God, before Fricke largely abandoned electronic instruments in favour of piano-led compositions from 1972's album Hosianna Mantra going forward. Additionally, Hosianna Mantra marked the growing exploration of \"spiritual matters\", inspired by both western and eastern religions, picking up a wider range of wind and string instruments, which were combined to convey a mystical aura that made their music spiritual and introspective. The European influence is \"particularly evident on the album's later tracks such as 'Not High in Heaven', 'Kyrie', and 'Blessing'.\"[8].\nPossible Next Actions: search[the kentucky headhunters], search[holy cross church (marion county, kentucky)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[the kentucky headhunters]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Kentucky Headhunters are an American country rock and Southern rock band originating in the state of Kentucky.

Their Columbia works produced three chart singles, including the number one \"Highwayman\" in 1985.. Between 1996 and 1998, Nelson, Kristofferson, Cash, and Jennings provided the voice and dramatization for the Louis L'Amour Collection, a four-CD box set of seven Louis L'Amour stories published by the HighBridge Company, although the four were not credited as \"The Highwaymen\" in this work..

Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, David Allan Coe and Jerry Jeff Walker were among the movement's most commercially successful members.. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like Western, honky tonk, rockabilly, and progressive country, and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation, and introspective lyrics.[3][4] The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and limiting structures of the Nashville sound developed by Chet Atkins and other record producers.[3][5]. Some country fans consider outlaw country a slightly harder-edged variant of progressive country.[6] The outlaw sound has its roots in blues music,[7] honky tonk music of the 1940s and 1950s, rockabilly of the 1950s, and the evolving genre of rock and roll.[4][8] Early outlaws were particularly influenced by predecessors such as Bob Wills, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, and Buddy Holly.

First produced in the 1920s, country music is primarily focused on singing stories about working-class and blue-collar American life.[3]. Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (i.e., \"honky-tonk music\") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and many types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator guitars).[1][4][5] Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of American folk music, such as old-time music and Appalachian music,[6][7] many other traditions, including Mexican, Irish, and Hawaiian music, have had a formative influence on the genre.[8] Blues modes from blues music have been used extensively throughout its history as well.[9]. Once called \"hillbilly music\", the term country music gained popularity in the 1940s. The genre came to encompass western music, which evolved parallel to \u201chillbilly music\u201d from similar roots, in the mid-20th century.\nPossible Next Actions: finish[country music]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: finish[country music]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Terminal State\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The answer of country music is likely correct based on the information obtained from the previous searches.

The medieval knight was usually a mounted and armoured soldier, often connected with nobility or royalty, although (especially in north-eastern Europe) knights could also come from the lower classes, and could even be enslaved persons.

Scholars usually consider a castle to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a mansion, palace, and villa, whose main purpose was exclusively for pleasance and are not primarily fortresses but may be fortified.[a] Use of the term has varied over time and, sometimes, has also been applied to structures such as hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes built to resemble castles. Over the Middle Ages, when genuine castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace.. European-style castles originated in the 9th\u00a0and 10th\u00a0centuries after the fall of the Carolingian Empire, which resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes.\nCurrent Action: search[york castle]\nCurrent Observation: York Castle is a fortified complex in the city of York, England.

Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city of J\u00f3rv\u00edk, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued to be used as a gaol and prison until 1929..

Although a small number of castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone \u2013 with characteristic square keep \u2013 that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom.\nPossible Next Actions: search[norman conquest], search[monmouth castle], search[motte-and-bailey castle]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[monmouth castle]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Monmouth Castle (Welsh: Castell Trefynwy) is a castle close to the centre of the town of Monmouth, the county town of Monmouthshire, on a hill above the River Monnow in south-east Wales..

For several reasons, whether a given site is that of a medieval castle has not been taken to be a sufficient criterion for determining whether or not that site should be included in the list.. Castles that have vanished or whose remains are barely visible are not listed, except for some important or well-known buildings and sites.

At the accession of Henry III only a remnant of English holdings remained in Gascony, for which English kings had to pay homage to the French, and the barons were in revolt. Royal authority was restored by his son who inherited the throne in 1272 as Edward I. He reorganized his possessions, and gained control of Wales and most of Scotland. His son Edward II was defeated at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and lost control of Scotland.\nPossible Next Actions: search[england], search[castle drogo], search[chillingham castle]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[chillingham castle]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Chillingham Castle is a medieval castle in the village of Chillingham in the northern part of Northumberland, England.

Surrounded by extensive artificial lakes \u2013 considered by historian Allen Brown to be \"the most elaborate water defences in all Britain\" \u2013 it occupies around 30 acres (12\u00a0ha) and is the largest castle in Wales and the second-largest castle in the United Kingdom after Windsor Castle.[3] It is famous for having introduced concentric castle defences to Britain and for its large gatehouses. Gilbert began work on the castle in 1268 following his occupation of the north of Glamorgan, with the majority of the construction occurring over the next three years at a considerable cost. The project was opposed by Gilbert's Welsh rival Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, leading to the site being burnt in 1270 and taken over by royal officials in 1271.\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of castles in wales], search[beverston castle], search[capital punishment in the united kingdom], search[castle hill, new south wales]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[castle hill, new south wales]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Castle Hill is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, located 34 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district[3] and 9.5 kilometres north of Parramatta.[4] It is within the Hills District region, split between the local government areas of The Hills Shire and Hornsby Shire..

Reverse discrimination based on race or ethnicity is also called reverse racism.[1]. Philosopher Richard Arneson argues that while a program of reverse discrimination favoring non-White candidates over White ones may violate equality of opportunity in a formal sense, it may more effectively promote substantive equality.[2] The Dilemma of difference refers to the difference between the two equality concepts.[3]. Affirmative action is a set of practices that attempts to promote diversity in areas such as employment, education, and leadership, typically by reserving some positions for people of traditionally disadvantaged groups. This may result in discrimination towards successful majority groups who have greater technical qualifications than minority applicants.[4].\nCurrent Action: search[women's empowerment]\nCurrent Observation: Women's empowerment (or female empowerment) may be defined in several method, including accepting women's viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, equal status in society, better livelihood and training.[1][2][3] Women's empowerment equips and allows women to make life-determining decisions through the different societal problems.[3] They may have the opportunity to re-define gender roles or other such roles, which allow them more freedom to pursue desired goals.[1]. Women's empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics.\u00a0Economic empowerment allows women to control and benefit from resources, assets, and income. It also aids in the ability to manage risks and improve women's well-being.[4] It can result in approaches to support trivialized genders in a particular political or social context.[5]  While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of gender empowerment concerns people of any gender, stressing the distinction between biological and gender as a role. Women empowerment helps boost women's status through literacy, education, training and awareness creation.[6] Furthermore, women's empowerment refers to women's ability to make strategic life choices that were previously denied them.[7]. Nations, businesses, communities and groups may benefit from implementing programs and policies that adopt the notion of female empowerment.[8] Women's empowerment enhances the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.[9] Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development..\nPossible Next Actions: search[reverse racism]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[reverse racism]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Reverse racism, sometimes referred to as reverse discrimination,[1] is the concept that affirmative action and similar color-conscious programs for redressing racial inequality are forms of anti-white racism.[2] The concept is often associated with conservative social movements,[2][3] and reflects a belief that social and economic gains by Black people and other people of color cause disadvantages for white people.[4][5][6]. Belief in reverse racism is widespread in the United States; however, there is little to no empirical evidence that white Americans are disadvantaged as a group.[7] Racial and ethnic minorities generally lack the ability to damage the interests of whites, who remain the dominant group in the U.S.[8][9] Claims of reverse racism tend to ignore such disparities in the exercise of power,[1][10][11] which most sociologists and psychologists include in their definition of racism.[1][8]. Allegations of reverse racism by opponents of affirmative action began to emerge in the 1970s,[2][12] and have formed part of a racial backlash against social gains by people of color.[13] While the U.S. dominates the debate over the issue, the concept of reverse racism has been used internationally to some extent wherever white supremacy has diminished, such as in post-apartheid South Africa.[4]. The concept of reverse racism in the United States is commonly associated with conservative opposition to color-conscious policies aimed at addressing racial inequality, such as affirmative action.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for reverse racism provides information that is at the background level to answering the question, as it discusses a concept differently from what we are looking for.

Morris grew up in Seattle, Washington,[1] in a family that appreciated music and dance and nurtured his budding talents; his father Joe taught him to read music and his mother Maxine introduced him to flamenco and ballet. Joe was a high school teacher while Maxine cared for the children at home.[2]:\u200a15\u200a Morris had two older sisters, Marianne and Maureen.[2]:\u200a15\u200a Everyone in his family were performers, playing instruments, singing in chorus, and dancing.[2]:\u200a16\u200a In grade school Morris's neighborhood population changed, with many Black and Asian families moving in, and many white families moving out, with exceptions such as the Morrises.[2]:\u200a18\u200a This led to flourishing art from many different cultures, including a Japanese Bon Odori festival, as well as a Samoan dance ensemble at Morris's high school,[2]:\u200a18\u200a influencing Morris's later interest in dance cultures outside of Western dance. He began Spanish dance training with Verla Flowers at age eight.[2]:\u200a21\u200a Flowers also introduced Morris to ballet, which was considered an effeminate art form even then.[2]:\u200a22\u200a He also participated in a folk dance group, the Koleda Folk Ensemble, for many years of his childhood, which is said to have had a profound effect on his later choreography.[2]:\u200a26\u200a Throughout Morris's childhood he experienced discrimination for appearing effeminate, which contributed to much of his later choreography.[2]:\u200a25\u200a Koleda had a variety of sexual identities and orientations, which is why it was so important to him.[2]:\u200a31\u200a By age 14 he had choreographed his first modern piece, and by 15 his first ballet piece.[2]:\u200a33\u200a When Morris was 16, his father died.[2]:\u200a40\u200a His father's death and their relationship contributed to Morris's later piece Dad\u2019s Charts.[2]:\u200a40\u200a After graduating from high school, Morris moved to Madrid to study flamenco with the goal of becoming a Spanish dancer, and briefly toured with the Royal Chamber Ballet of Madrid.[2]:\u200a40\u200a He returned home to Seattle after five months, having experienced ongoing discrimination in Spain for being gay.[2]:\u200a41\u200a He then trained for a year and a half with Perry Brunson, formerly of the Joffrey Ballet.[2]:\u200a41\u200a He then moved to New York at 19 to begin his career as a choreographer.[2]:\u200a41\u200a Once in New York he danced with choreographers Eliot Feld, Lar Lubovitch, Laura Dean and Hannah Kahn.[3] By 1980 he launched his company with ten dancers.[3].\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of russian ballet dancers]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of russian ballet dancers]\nObservation of Best Successor State: This is a list of ballet dancers from the Russian Empire, Soviet Union, and Russian Federation, including both ethnic Russians and people of other ethnicities.

African-American history began in the 16th century, with Africans from West Africa and coastal Central Africa being sold to European slave traders and transported across the Atlantic to the Western Hemisphere. After arriving in the Americas, they were sold as slaves to European colonists and put to work on plantations, particularly in the southern colonies. A few were able to achieve freedom through manumission or escape, and founded independent communities before and during the American Revolution.\nPossible Next Actions: search[american football in the united states], search[tuskegee syphilis study]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[tuskegee syphilis study]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male[1] (informally referred to as the Tuskegee Experiment or Tuskegee Syphilis Study) was a study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a group of nearly 400 African American men with syphilis.[2][3] The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated, though by the end of the study medical advancements meant it was entirely treatable.

After working as a teacher, he moved to London and began writing for The Gentleman's Magazine.\nCurrent Action: search[new foot-ball club]\nCurrent Observation: The New Foot-Ball Club, especially known by its original name of (Society) Foot-ball Sky, was a Spanish football club based in Madrid that was founded in 1897 by Cambridge and Oxford University graduates, and dissolved in 1903 due to internal differences and numerous splits in its 6-year history.[1] In 1900, a conflict between Sky Football members caused some of them to leave and found a new club that would later become Real Madrid,[1] and in 1901, a new split within the club led to the creation of Club Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid, and finally, in January 1903, a new and definitive split led to the disappearance of the club, with New's best players founding Internacional Foot-ball Club.[2]. Sky Football is best known for being the first-ever football club in the capital with the sole purpose of practicing this sport, and it was until the year 1900, the only existing club legalized for its exclusive practice in Madrid. Their original name was Sky Football, but following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as New Foot-Ball Club, the name under which it competed in the 1902 Copa de la Coronaci\u00f3n, the first national championship disputed in Spain and the forerunner for the Copa del Rey.[3]. New's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[1] For the Spaniards, football meant a distraction from the pessimism that was taking over Spain due to the loss of its last overseas territories at the end of the 19th century. Football became their best source for escapism and so, together with the British graduates, they founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in December 1897,[4] commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa, one of the historical football areas of Madrid.[1] Sky Football was thus just the third football team in Madrid, only after Cricket and Football Club of Madrid (1879) and the Outdoor Games Society (1897), which were the first sports societies that included the practice of football among their activities.[5][6].\nPossible Next Actions: finish[new foot-ball club]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: finish[new foot-ball club]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Terminal State\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The answer of New Foot-Ball Club is likely correct based on the information found in the trajectory specifically that Samuel Johnson moved to London in 1900, which indirectly hints at football clubs moving around that time.

Tradition dictates that the captain of the Port Adelaide Football Club wear the number one guernsey \u2013 this started when Clifford Keal wore the number as club captain for the first time in 1924.[1] The tradition was cemented, at least in the view of then-secretary Charles Hayter, when in 1929 he received a letter from a junior Kilkenny player requesting a number one Port Adelaide guernsey as he had just become captain of his underage team.[2] Hayter granted the wish of the junior and provided him with a number one Port Adelaide guernsey.[2] Since 1924, there have been few exceptions to the tradition. The most notable exception was Geof Motley, who followed the captaincy of Fos Williams. Following his appointment as captain-coach, Motley elected to continue wearing the number 17, and continued to do so for the remainder of his career.[1] When Motley handed the captaincy to John Cahill in 1967, at the insistence of coach Fos Williams, the tradition of Port Adelaide captains wearing the number one guernsey resumed.[1] When co-captains were appointed for the 2019 season the No. 1 guernsey was temporarily retired, but it was re-instated the following season when the club returned to appointing a single captain.[3].\nPossible Next Actions: search[dwayne johnson], search[adam johnson (footballer)], search[bethel johnson]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[adam johnson (footballer)]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Adam Johnson (born 14 July 1987) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger.

The Cotswolds lie just to the town's north and the North Wessex Downs to its south.. Recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as Suindune, the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1843 transformed it from a small market town of 2,500 into a thriving railway hub that would become one of the largest railway engineering complexes in the world at its peak.[2][3] This brought with it pioneering amenities such as the UK's first lending library and a 'cradle-to-grave' healthcare centre that was later used as a blueprint for the NHS.[4] Swindon's railway heritage can be primarily seen today with the grade 2 listed Railway Village and STEAM Museum.[5][6] The McArthurGlen Designer Outlet is housed in the renovated former works and the Brunel Shopping Centre is one of several places in Swindon that bear the name of the famous engineer generally acknowledged with bringing the railways to the town.[7][8]. Despite the subsequent decline and closure of its railway works, Swindon was one of the fastest growing towns in Europe post-war as its economy diversified, attracting large international companies, who made use of its burgeoning population and strategic transport links.[9][10].\nPossible Next Actions: search[county ground (swindon)], search[list of swindon town f.c. managers], search[jake o'brien (footballer)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of swindon town f.c. managers]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The current manager of Swindon Town Football Club is Ian Holloway.

The title was originally scheduled to be defended exclusively at NEVER events, but this plan was quickly changed and since its foundation, the title has been defended on the undercards of NJPW events.[2][10] The original concept of having younger workers wrestle for the title has also not been realized with the first seven holders of the title having been in their thirties or forties.[11][12] Instead, through the likes of Katsuyori Shibata, Togi Makabe, and Tomohiro Ishii, the NEVER Openweight Championship became known for its \"gritty\" title matches and \"hard hitting\" style.[13][14] Though named an \"openweight\" championship, NJPW has also categorized the title as a heavyweight title.[15][16] The title forms what has unofficially been called the \"New Japan Triple Crown\" (\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u30c8\u30ea\u30d7\u30eb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3, Shin Nihon Toripuru Kuraun) along with the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.[17] The title's openweight nature means that both heavyweight and junior heavyweight wrestlers are eligible to challenge for it.[18]. On October 5, 2012, over two years after the founding of NEVER, New Japan Pro-Wrestling announced the creation of the project's first championship, the NEVER Openweight Championship.[1][2][19] The title was originally created with the idea of using it to \"elevate younger wrestlers\".[20]. The first champion was to be determined in a sixteen-man single-elimination tournament, which was set to take place November 15 and 19, 2012.[21][22] The title and the tournament were announced by New Japan president Naoki Sugabayashi and NEVER regular Tetsuya Naito,[2][19] who was scheduled to enter the tournament, but was forced to pull out after suffering a knee injury.[10] Much like regular NEVER events, the tournament also featured wrestlers not signed to New Japan; freelancer Daisuke Sasaki, Hiro Tonai, Kengo Mashimo, Ryuichi Sekine, Shiori Asahi and Taishi Takizawa from Kaientai Dojo, and Masato Tanaka from Pro Wrestling Zero1.[21][22] In the final of the tournament, Tanaka, the 39-year-old, who, despite officially being affiliated with Pro Wrestling Zero1, had worked for NJPW regularly since August 2009, defeated Karl Anderson to become the inaugural NEVER Openweight Champion.[3][23][24][25] Though the title was originally designed to be defended at NEVER events, NJPW has not held a single NEVER event since the championship tournament.[20].\nCurrent Action: lookup[wrestling promotion]\nCurrent Observation: (Result 2 / 3) List of professional wrestling promotions in Japan.\nPossible Next Actions: search[njpw world television championship], search[don callis family]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[don callis family]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Don Callis Family is a villainous. professional wrestling stable led and managed by Don Callis.

Later in its history, especially in the 1990s, it became a heavily contested form of learning, seen by some as an appropriate foundation of a liberal arts education, and by others as a tool of promoting a Eurocentric or Anglocentric society by solely focusing on the works of \"dead white men\".[3] Largely driven by student protests, the Core in recent decades has been revised to add focus on non-Western cultures, as well as postcolonial works to the literature and philosophy sequences. The most recent major addition to the Core was made in the 2000s with the addition of \"Frontiers of Science\", a scientific literacy course, to the curriculum.. Early instruction at Columbia College, from its founding in 1754 as King's College, almost entirely revolved around the study of the classics, and entering students were expected to already be fluent in Ancient Greek and Latin.[4] Through most of the 19th century, all students were prescribed a single course of studies, save for a period of time beginning in 1830, when the college introduced the \"Literary and Scientific course\" in addition to the standard curriculum, which was dubbed the \"Full course\".\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for Columbia College's core curriculum was an extensive observation.

Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses.[3]. The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, mostly expanding it.

The concept of the \"ace\" emerged in 1915 during World War I, at the same time as aerial dogfighting. It was a propaganda term intended to provide the home front with a cult of the hero in what was otherwise a war of attrition. The individual actions of aces were widely reported and the image was disseminated of the ace as a chivalrous knight reminiscent of a bygone era.[1] For a brief early period when air-to-air combat was just being invented, the exceptionally skilled pilot could shape the battle in the skies. For most of the war, however, the image of the ace had little to do with the reality of air warfare, in which fighters fought in formation and air superiority depended heavily on the relative availability of resources.[2] The use of the term ace to describe these pilots began in World War\u00a0I, when French newspapers described Adolphe P\u00e9goud, as l'As (the ace) after he became the first pilot to down five German aircraft.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for flying ace provides information that does not directly answer the question about the top Italian fighter ace who used the Prancing Horse symbol.

Towards the end of the war, the Axis powers had largely exhausted their supply of skilled pilots and the replacements did not have as much opportunity to gain enough experience to be successful.

When aircraft began to shoot or force down other aircraft, systems to count \"air victories\" were subsequently developed. The American qualification of five victories eventually became the standard, even though other air services had previously used differing figures.[1]. While \"ace\" status was most often won by fighter pilots, bomber and reconnaissance crews, and observers in two-seater aircraft such as the Bristol F.2b (\"Bristol Fighter\"), also destroyed enemy aircraft.

Sedaka noted that Elvis Presley, the biggest rock star in America in the late 1950s, never left North America/Hawaii (in part because his agent Colonel Tom Parker lived in the U.S. illegally[citation needed]), and this opened opportunities in foreign markets such as Japan for more obscure artists such as Sedaka to gain a foothold there.[4] Jimmy Osmond, typically a side show to his older brothers The Osmonds in North America and Europe, cut several tracks in Japanese and received several gold records for his recordings.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for \"Big in Japan\" provides a key piece of information that Sedaka was the first Westerner to make it big in Japan with his song \"One Way Ticket\".

Honorific nicknames were used in classical music in Europe even in the early 19th century, with figures such as Mozart being called \"The father of modern music\" and Bach \"The father of modern piano music\".[1] They were also particularly prominent in African-American culture in the post-Civil War era, perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery,[2] and as a result entered early jazz and blues music, including figures such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie.[3]. In U.S. culture, despite its republican constitution and ideology,[4] royalist honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity, such as industry, commerce, sports, and the media; father or mother have been used for innovators, and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field.[5][6] In the 1930s and 1940s, as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity, it was the more commercially successful white artists Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman who became known as \"the King of Jazz\" and \"the King of Swing\" respectively, despite there being more highly regarded contemporary African-American artists.[7].

Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time.

In the early 17th century, the area was inhabited by Lenape and possibly Assateague Native American Indian tribes. The first European settlers were Swedes, who established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, in 1638. The Dutch captured the colony in 1655 and annexed it to New Netherland to the north.

Video game genres are not usually defined by the setting or story of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.[1] For example, a first-person shooter is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a science fiction, western, fantasy, or military setting, so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist (first-person) and gameplay centered around the use of ranged weaponry.. Genres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called subgenres. For example, an action game can be classified into many subgenres such as platform games and fighting games. Some games, most notably browser and mobile games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.[1][2].\nCurrent Action: search[arcade video game]\nCurrent Observation: An arcade video game is an arcade game that takes player input from its controls, processes it through electrical or computerized components, and displays output to an electronic monitor or similar display. All arcade video games are coin-operated or accept other means of payment, housed in an arcade cabinet, and located in amusement arcades alongside other kinds of arcade games. Until the early 2000s, arcade video games were the largest[1] and most technologically advanced[2][3] segment of the video game industry.. Early prototypical entries Galaxy Game and Computer Space in 1971 established the principle operations for arcade games, and Atari's Pong in 1972 is recognized as the first successful commercial arcade video game. Improvements in computer technology and gameplay design led to a golden age of arcade video games, the exact dates of which are debated but range from the late 1970s to the early 1980s.\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of xbox game studios video games], search[list of racing video games], search[sports video game], search[list of video games considered the best]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[sports video game]\nObservation of Best Successor State: A sports video game is a video game that simulates the practice of sports.

Players wear power armor, called Battleframes, that grants health regeneration, jump jets, and a retractable pair of wings that allows players to glide. Each Battleframe has a unique main weapon, a standard secondary weapon, a set of three unique abilities, and a fourth special ability that charges while the player is in combat. There are five main types of Battleframes.[8] The player begins with the standard issue version of each of the five types of Battleframes, and can change between them freely. Players level up by completing missions and collect equipment from downed enemies to further enhance their Battleframe's attributes or to add entirely new features to their weapons and abilities.\nCurrent Action: search[pentiment (video game)]\nCurrent Observation: Pentiment is a 2022 adventure role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios.

Games with open or free-roaming worlds typically lack level structures like walls and locked doors, or the invisible walls in more open areas that prevent the player from venturing beyond them; only at the bounds of an open-world game will players be limited by geographic features like vast oceans or impassable mountains. Players typically do not encounter loading screens common in linear level designs when moving about the game world, with the open-world game using strategic storage and memory techniques to load the game world dynamically and seamlessly. Open-world games still enforce many restrictions in the game environment, either because of absolute technical limitations or in-game limitations imposed by a game's linearity.[5]. While the openness of the game world is an important facet to games featuring open worlds, the main draw of open-world games is about providing the player with autonomy\u2014not so much the freedom to do anything they want in the game (which is nearly impossible with current computing technology), but the ability to choose how to approach the game and its challenges in the order and manner as the player desires while still constrained by gameplay rules.[6] Examples of high level of autonomy in computer games can be found in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) or in single-player games adhering to the open-world concept such as the Fallout series.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for open world racing video game provides information about open world game characteristics, which is background level to answering the question since we are looking for a specific game.

For example, using x,y,z as variables, and taking f to be an uninterpreted function, the singleton equation set { f(1,y) = f(x,2) } is a syntactic first-order unification problem that has the substitution { x \u21a6 1, y \u21a6 2 } as its only solution.. Conventions differ on what values variables may assume and which expressions are considered equivalent. In first-order syntactic unification, variables range over first-order terms and equivalence is syntactic. This version of unification has a unique \"best\" answer and is used in logic programming and programming language type system implementation, especially in Hindley\u2013Milner based type inference algorithms.\nPossible Next Actions: search[the new school]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[the new school]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The New School is a private research university in New York City.

Initially termed \"progressive pop\", the style was an emergence of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk, or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \"progressive\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"art\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing.. Progressive rock is based on fusions of styles, approaches and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism.

In 2014, Guilin Liangjiang International Airport was the 33rd busiest airport in China with 5,875,327 passengers.[3] Around 4 million passengers transit through Liangjiang Airport annually, traveling to one of the 48 domestic and international destinations served nonstop from Guilin.[2][4]. In September 1991, the State Council of China and the Central Military Commission approved a 1.85 billion yuan project to build a new airport to replace Guilin Qifengling Airport as Guilin's civil airport. Construction began in July 1993, and Liangjiang Airport was opened on 1 October 1996.[4].\nCurrent Action: search[ankang wulipu airport]\nCurrent Observation: Ankang Wulipu Airport (Chinese: \u5b89\u5eb7\u4e94\u91cc\u94fa\u673a\u573a) was an airport serving the city of Ankang in Shaanxi Province, China. It was located in the town of Wuli in Hanbin District, 9 kilometres (5.6\u00a0mi) from the city center.[1] The new Ankang Fuqiang Airport replaced the Wulipu Airport when it opened on September 25, 2020.[2]. The airport had one runway that is 1,600 meters long and 30 meters wide (class 3C), and a 1,200 square-meter terminal building.[1]. With the threat of the Empire of Japan following the Manchurian Incident of 1931, General Yang Hucheng first built the airfield in Ankang in 1933 for preparations in the support of anticipated air force operations against Imperial Japanese military ambitions; this was the airbase where Chinese Air Force war hero Colonel Gao Zhihang transited en route after receiving a new inventory of Polikarpov I-16 fighter planes in November 1937, but was killed in a Japanese bombing attack in his next refueling stop at Zhoujiakou airfield.[3][4] The airfield was deemed unsafe for use however, and was rebuilt as Wulipu in 1938, and listed as the 59th Air Station of the Nationalist Air Force of China.[1][5]  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the airport was in use by the United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as part of the China Defensive Campaign. The Americans called the airbase Ankang Airfield, and flew photo-reconnaissance aircraft from the airport over Japanese-held territory on intelligence gathering combat missions between April and August 1945.\nPossible Next Actions: search[g65 baotou\u2013maoming expressway], finish[china]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: finish[china]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Terminal State\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The answer of China is likely correct as the location of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport is confirmed to be in South Central China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Ankang Wulipu Airport is also located in Shaanxi Province, China.

After unrestricted submarine warfare began in February 1915, any ship could be sunk unexpectedly from the heavy underwater hull damage inflicted by torpedoes.

The Russian fleet had suffered such attrition from Japanese mines and combat with the Japanese fleet during 1904 that the Russian high command made the fateful decision to dispatch the Baltic Fleet in October of that year to the Pacific coast base at Vladivostok. This involved an exhausting voyage of over seven months; those ships that went down the Atlantic, around Cape of Good Hope, across the Indian Ocean and up the China Sea eventually covered 17,000\u00a0mi (27,000\u00a0km) before ending in disaster as the fleet attempted to transit Tsushima Strait..

At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was blockaded within the confines of Port Arthur by the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, the Russian subsidiary naval base at Vladivostok, although shelled by a Japanese squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Dewa Shiget\u014d in March 1904, remained largely undamaged and unblockaded.

There are numerous examples of brand blunders in marketing history; there are also numerous urban legends surrounding brand blunders, where there is little evidence of an actual blunder.. Problems with international product branding are often associated with the process of language localisation, in which the product brand name or advertising slogan carries a different meaning in the language of the target market.[1] In addition to linguistic aspects, issues of cultural sensitivity can affect the success of a brand..

Pretoria is the administrative capital, while Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital, and Bloemfontein is regarded as the judicial capital.[19] The largest, most populous city is Johannesburg, followed by Cape Town and Durban.. Archaeological findings suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa about 2.5 million years ago, and modern humans inhabited the region over 100,000 years ago.

Donate.\nCurrent Action: search[hiv/aids denialism]\nCurrent Observation: HIV/AIDS denialism is the belief, despite conclusive evidence to the contrary, that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).[1][2][3] Some of its proponents reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that HIV exists but argue that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS. Insofar as they acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior, recreational drugs, malnutrition, poor sanitation, haemophilia, or the effects of the medications used to treat HIV infection (antiretrovirals).[4][5]. The scientific consensus is that the evidence showing HIV to be the cause of AIDS is conclusive[1][2] and that HIV/AIDS denialist claims are pseudoscience based on conspiracy theories,[6] faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data.[1][2][7] As evidence mounted against denialism, combined with those with HIV/AIDS living much longer, these claims stopped being believed.[8] With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, HIV/AIDS denialist material is now targeted at less scientifically sophisticated audiences and spread mainly through the Internet,[9][10] increased substantially since the COVID-19 pandemic.[8]. Despite its lack of scientific acceptance, HIV/AIDS denialism has had a significant political impact, especially in South Africa under the presidency of Thabo Mbeki. Scientists and physicians have raised alarm at the human cost of HIV/AIDS denialism, which discourages HIV-positive people from using proven treatments.[2][9][11][12][13][14] Public health researchers have attributed 330,000 to 340,000 AIDS-related deaths, along with 171,000 other HIV infections and 35,000 infant HIV infections, to the South African government's former embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism.[15][16] The interrupted use of antiretroviral treatments is also a major global concern as it potentially increases the likelihood of the emergence of antiretroviral-resistant strains of the virus.[17].\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of english-language generic internet top-level domains], search[president's emergency plan for aids relief]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[president's emergency plan for aids relief]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The United States President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the global health funding by the United States to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and help save the lives of those suffering from the disease.

Initially, infected foreign nationals were turned back at the United States border to help prevent additional infections.[5][6] The number of United States deaths from AIDS has declined sharply since the early years of the disease's presentation domestically.[1] In the United States in 2016, 1.1 million people aged over 13 lived with an HIV infection, of whom 14% were unaware of their infection.[1] African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, homosexual and bisexual men, and intravenous drug users remain the most disproportionately affected populations in the United States.[1][4]. As of 2018[update], about 700,000 people have died of HIV/AIDS in the United States since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and nearly 13,000 people with AIDS in the United States die each year.[7].
