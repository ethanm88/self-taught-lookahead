Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol.[2] While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses.[3] Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.[4].\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of old harrovians]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of old harrovians]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The following is a list of some notable Old Harrovians, former pupils of Harrow School in the United Kingdom..

Alfred styled himself king of the Anglo-Saxons from about 886, and while he was not the first king to claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the start of the first unbroken line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.[1]. Arguments are made for a few different kings thought to have controlled enough Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to be deemed the first king of England. For example, Offa of Mercia and Egbert of Wessex are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but it is no longer the majority view of historians that their wide dominions were part of a process leading to a unified England. The historian Simon Keynes states, for example, \"Offa was driven by a lust for power, not a vision of English unity; and what he left was a reputation, not a legacy.\"[2] That refers to a period in the late 8th century, when Offa achieved a dominance over many of the kingdoms of southern England, but it did not survive his death in 796.[3][4] Likewise, in 829 Egbert of Wessex conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it..\nPossible Next Actions: search[lists of ancient monarchs]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[lists of ancient monarchs]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Lists of ancient monarchs are organized by region and peoples, and include rulers recorded in ancient history (3000 BC \u2013 1700 AD) and mythology..

In the song, however, he said he used the phrase in reference to gossip about someone who carries out clandestine sexual relationships.

In the Early Middle Ages, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, standard medical knowledge was based chiefly upon surviving Greek and Roman texts, preserved in monasteries and elsewhere. Medieval medicine is widely misunderstood, thought of as a uniform attitude composed of placing hopes in the church and God to heal all sicknesses, while sickness itself exists as a product of destiny, sin, and astral influences as physical causes.

In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers \u2013 British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple \u2013 were founded.[3] Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen.[4] During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence,[5][6] while Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\".\nPossible Next Actions: search[lonelygirl15]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[lonelygirl15]\nObservation of Best Successor State: lonelygirl15 is an American science fiction thriller web series created by Miles Beckett, Mesh Flinders, Greg Goodfried, and Amanda Goodfried.

In Afghanistan, sporting contests against Pakistan are followed intensely.[1][2][3] The rivalry, stemming from geopolitical and cultural ties between the two states, has been compared in some aspects to the more longstanding, traditional archrivalry between India and Pakistan in sports.[2]. The two countries share a long and porous international border dating back to the 19th century, with a history of immigration and economic relations. People on both sides of the border, primarily the Pashtuns, share ethnic and cultural ties.[2] However, at a political level, relations between both governments in the past have often been characterised as frosty, thus paving the way for a competitive rivalry in sporting encounters in recent times.[1][4].\nPossible Next Actions: search[2017 invictus games], search[afghanistan\u2013pakistan relations]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[2017 invictus games]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The 2017 Invictus Games was a parasport event for wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and their associated veterans, which was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

This continuity allows for the development of storylines and characters over time, fostering audience engagement and investment in the characters' lives and relationships..

Biological pest control methods such as the fostering of insect predators are also encouraged.[6] Organic agriculture can be defined as \"an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity while, with rare exceptions, prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones\".[7][8][9][10] It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Certified organic agriculture accounted for 70\u00a0million hectares (170\u00a0million acres) globally in 2019, with over half of that total in Australia.[11].

Ptolemy, a general and one of the somatophylakes (bodyguard companions) of Alexander the Great, was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander's death in 323 BC. In 305\u00a0BC he declared himself Pharaoh Ptolemy I, later known as S\u014dter \"Saviour\". The Egyptians soon accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt.[a] The new dynasty showed respect to local traditions and adopted the Egyptian titles and iconography, while also preserving their own Greek language and culture.[8][6] The Ptolemaic period was marked by the intense interactions and blending of the Greek and Egyptian cultures.[9] Under the Ptolemies, Hellenistic religion was largely shaped by religious syncretism and imperial cult.[10][11] Elements of Greek education became widespread in urban spaces, culminating in the foundation of the Mouseion (including the Library of Alexandria) and the Serapeum.[12] During the Hellenistic period, the city of Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great, would gradually surpass Athens taking its place as the intellectual centre of the Mediterranean world.[13].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for the Ptolemaic dynasty provides the information that the Ptolemaic dynasty was active for 275 years.

Issued by a council of priests confirming the royal cult of Ptolemy V in 196 BC at Memphis, it was written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian Demotic and Ancient Greek. It mentions the Egyptian rebellion against the Greek rulers, otherwise known only through Greek sources and remains of graffiti.[1]. The native Egyptian population at home was treated as second-class citizens by its Greek rulers and imperialists, while the economy had suffered because of the wars.[1] Seleucids, for example, won over the previously Ptolemaic-ruled territory of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, after the Battle of Panium (198 BC), while other territories were divided between Antiochus\u00a0III the Great and Philip\u00a0V of Macedon, who had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace. During the reign of Ptolemy\u00a0IV,[2] there was a long-standing revolt led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer, which had begun in the south of Egypt.[3] These were still ongoing when the young Ptolemy\u00a0V was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign).[4] Egyptian cities joining the rebellion had faced economic and political consequences, such as the closure of ports, evidence has shown.[1].\nPossible Next Actions: search[ptolemy xii auletes], search[antigonid dynasty], search[ptolemy i soter], search[ptolemy v]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[ptolemy v]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Ptolemy V Epiphanes Eucharistus[note 1][4] (Greek: \u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f18\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u1f50\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, Ptolema\u0129os Epiphan\u1e17s Eukh\u00e1ristos \"Ptolemy the Manifest, the Beneficent\"; 9 October 210\u2013September 180 BC) was the King of Ptolemaic Egypt from July or August 204 BC until his death in 180 BC..

The new regent, Agathocles, was widely reviled and was toppled by a revolution in 202 BC, but the series of regents who followed proved incompetent and the kingdom was paralysed.

Stereotypes of East Asians, analogous to other ethnic and racial stereotypes, are often erroneously misunderstood and negatively portrayed in American mainstream media, cinema,  music, television, literature, video games, internet, as well as in other forms of creative expression in American culture and society. Many of these commonly generalized stereotypes are largely correlative to those that are also found in other Anglosphere countries, such as in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as entertainment and mass media are often closely interlinked between them.. Largely and collectively, these stereotypes have been internalized by society and in daily interactions, current events, and government legislation, their repercussions for Americans or immigrants of East Asian ancestry are mainly negative.[1][2] Media portrayals of East Asians often reflect an Americentric perception rather than authentic depictions of East Asian cultures, customs, traditions, and behaviors.[1] East Asian Americans have experienced discrimination and have been victims of bullying and hate crimes related to their ethnic stereotypes, as it has been used to reinforce xenophobic sentiments.[1][3] Notable fictional stereotypes include Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan, which respectively represents a threatening, mysterious East Asian character as well as an apologetic, submissive, \"good\" East Asian character.[4]. East Asian American men are often stereotyped as physically unattractive and lacking social skills.[5] This contrasts with the common view of East Asian women being perceived as highly desirable relative to their white female counterparts, which often manifests itself in the form of the Asian fetish, which has been influenced by their portrayals as hyper-feminine \"Lotus Blossom Babies\", \"China dolls\", \"Geisha girls\", and war brides.[6] In media, East Asian women may be stereotyped as exceptionally feminine and delicate \"Lotus Blossums\", or as Dragon Ladies, while East Asian men are often stereotyped as sexless or nerdy.[7].\nPossible Next Actions: search[pacific meridional mode], search[list of hong kong films of 1971], search[1989 in australia]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[pacific meridional mode]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) is a climate mode in the North Pacific.

It included equality in employment, enlisting in the military, freedom to worship and allowing churches to address their own finances and  several matters with their followers.[1] The decree was part of the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 which sought to address inequalities between Muslim and non-Muslim citizens, mainly affecting the Coptic Christian minority.[2] The law mandated that the Ottoman Sultan must issue permits for any construction or maintenance of churches, and the Coptic Pope had to apply for all such permits.[1] After the end of Ottoman rule, only the king, and then the President of Egypt could issue these permits, although in 1999, under the administration of Hosni Mubarak, the law was changed to also allow Egyptian Governors to grant permits.[3] The decree is often confused with the 1934 Ten Conditions of Al-Ezabi,[4] which enlarged the restrictions and added ten limiting conditions.[5] Although the original decree amended a ban on the construction of Coptic churches, today it is the subject of controversies over religious freedom.[6]. While ostensibly part of the Tanzimat reforms of the Ottoman Empire in the 1800s, the special restrictions on churches trace back to the Pact of Umar in the 7th century. This treaty included a provision against the building of new churches or other religious buildings, and became the jurisprudential basis for subsequent interactions between Muslim leaders and non-Muslim citizens.[7].

Human Rights Watch has documented increasing religious intolerance and attacks against Christian communities in recent decades, and has criticized the Egyptian government for its repeated failure to adequately investigate or prosecute such incidents.[5][6] In some cases, commentators and religious leaders have argued that incidents targeting Christians may be influenced by political or socio-economic tensions rather than religious motives alone..\nPossible Next Actions: search[ten conditions of al-ezabi]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[ten conditions of al-ezabi]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The legal foundation for the Egyptian state's control of church property was the Ottoman Hamayouni Decree of 1856.

Vivaldi would again set this psalm, but with three voice-parts and orchestral accompaniment (RV 803), in 1739.[2][3]. Nisi Dominus RV 608 is unusual in that it sets a Vesper Psalm for a solo voice.[4] It was composed between 1713 and 1717[5] during Vivaldi's engagement at the girls' orphanage Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 in Venice, where it was probably first performed.[6].\nPossible Next Actions: search[handel], search[maurice greene (composer)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[handel]\nObservation of Best Successor State: George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (/\u02c8h\u00e6nd\u0259l/ HAN-d\u0259l;[a] baptised Georg Fried[e]rich H\u00e4ndel,[b] German: [\u02c8\u0261e\u02d0\u0254\u0281k\u00a0\u02c8f\u0281i\u02d0d\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8h\u025bndl\u0329] \u24d8; 23 February 1685 \u2013 14 April 1759)[3][c] was a German-British Baroque composer well-known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concerti..

The Baroque period is divided into three major phases: early, middle, and late. Overlapping in time, they are conventionally dated from 1580 to 1650, from 1630 to 1700, and from 1680 to 1750. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \"classical music\" canon, and is widely studied, performed, and listened to. The term \"baroque\" comes from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning \"misshapen pearl\".[2] Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Domenico Scarlatti, Claudio Monteverdi, Alessandro Stradella, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Arcangelo Corelli, Fran\u00e7ois Couperin, Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber..\nPossible Next Actions: search[handel (name)], search[jean-baptiste loeillet of london]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[jean-baptiste loeillet of london]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Jean-Baptiste Loeillet of London (18 November 1680 \u2013 19 July 1730), was a Flemish composer and musician of the Baroque period.

The ISU World Figure Skating Championships introduced pair skating in 1908.. Like the other disciplines, pair skating competitions consist of two segments, the short program and the free skating program. There are seven required elements in the short program, which lasts two minutes and 40 seconds for both junior and senior pair teams. Free skating for pairs \"consists of a well balanced program composed and skated to music of the pair's own choice for a specified period of time\".[3] It also should contain \"especially typical Pair Skating moves\" such as pair spins, lifts, partner assisted jumps, spirals and other linking movements.\nPossible Next Actions: search[world figure skating championships], search[european figure skating championships], search[2021\u201322 figure skating season]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[world figure skating championships]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The World Figure Skating Championships are an annual figure skating competition sanctioned by the International Skating Union (ISU).

The non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (the short program and the free skate), which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals, and other elements or moves..

It was not until the early part of the 20th century, well after the establishment of organized skating competitions, when jumps with the potential of being completed with multiple revolutions were invented and when jumps were formally categorized. In the 1920s Austrian skaters began to perform the first double jumps in practice. Skaters experimented with jumps, and by the end of the period, the modern repertoire of jumps had been developed. Jumps did not have a major role in free skating programs during international competitions until the 1930s.\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of figure skaters (pair skating)], search[russian figure skating championships]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[russian figure skating championships]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Russian Figure Skating Championships (Russian: \u0427\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0444\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e) are held annually to crown the national champions of Russia.

During the first six months of the war, the IJN enjoyed spectacular success, inflicting heavy defeats on Allied forces while remaining undefeated in battle.[4] The attack on Pearl Harbor crippled the battleship arm of the US Pacific Fleet,[5] while Allied navies were devastated during Japan's conquest of Southeast Asia.[6] Land-based IJN aircraft were also responsible for the sinkings of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, the first time in history that capital ships were sunk by aerial attack while underway.[7] In April 1942, the Indian Ocean raid drove the Royal Navy from South East Asia.[8] After these successes, the Japanese concentrated on the elimination and neutralization of strategic points from which the Allies could launch counteroffensives against Japan's conquests.[6] However, at Coral Sea the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia,[6] while the defeat at Midway forced them onto the defensive. The campaign in the Solomon Islands, during which the Japanese lost a months-long battle of attrition, was a decisive defeat for the IJN; they had failed to commit sufficient forces in time to overcome the growing Allied strength in the Solomons.[9]. During 1943 the Allies were able to significantly reorganize and expand their forces, and American industrial strength began to turn the tide of the war.[10] The United States ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through a vastly greater industrial output and a modernization of its air and naval forces, while the Japanese wartime economy and military-technological innovation stagnated.[10] In 1943, the Japanese turned their attention to maintaining a defensive perimeter around their previous conquests. Land-based troops and aircraft on Japanese-held islands in Micronesia were tasked with absorbing and wear down an expected American counteroffensive.[10] However, American industrial power proved impossible for the Japanese to overcome; the Allied military forces that faced the Japanese in 1943 were so overwhelming in firepower and equipment[10] that from the end of 1943 to 1944 Japan's defensive perimeter began to buckle, and finally collapsed.[10] In June 1944, Japanese naval airpower was effectively annihilated during at the Philippine Sea, with American pilots terming it the \"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot,\"[11] while the battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 destroyed a large part of the IJN's surface fleet.[12] Consequently, the Japanese lost control of the Western Pacific and access to the oil fields of Southeast Asia, upon which the IJN was reliant for continued operations at sea.\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of musicals: a to l], search[target corporation], search[imperial japanese navy], search[pearl harbor attack], search[winco foods]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[pearl harbor attack]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Second Sino-Japanese War.

Using the card thus accrues debt that has to be repaid later.[1] Credit cards are one of the most widely used forms of payment across the world.[2]. A regular credit card differs from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month, or at the end of each statement cycle.[3] In contrast, credit cards allow consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged at a specific rate. A credit card also differs from a charge card in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller, and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.[citation needed] A credit card also differs from a debit card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card.. As of June 2018,[update] there were 7.753 billion credit cards in the world.[4] In 2020, there were 1.09 billion credit cards in circulation in the United States, and 72.5% of adults (187.3 million) in the country had at least one credit card.[5][6][7][8].\nPossible Next Actions: search[credit history], search[octopus holdings limited]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[octopus holdings limited]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Octopus Holdings Limited (Chinese: \u516b\u9054\u901a\u63a7\u80a1\u516c\u53f8) is a holding company based in Hong Kong jointly owned by five major transport companies in the city.

In a draft, teams take turns selecting from a pool of eligible players.

The process is similar to round-robin item allocation..

The Commandments appear in the earliest Church writings;[6] the Catechism states that they have \"occupied a predominant place\" in teaching the faith since the time of Augustine of Hippo (AD 354\u2013430).[7][8] The Church had no official standards for religious instruction until the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215;[9] evidence suggests the Commandments were used in Christian education in the early Church[10] and throughout the Middle Ages.[9] The perceived lack of instruction in them by some dioceses was the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the Church by Protestant reformers.[11] Afterward, the first Church-wide catechism in 1566 provided \"thorough discussions of each commandment\", but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments.[12] The most recent Catechism devotes a large section to interpret each of the commandments.[7]. Church teaching of the Commandments is largely based on the Old and New Testaments and the writings of the early Church Fathers.[13] In the New Testament, Jesus acknowledged their validity and instructed his disciples to go further, demanding a righteousness exceeding that of the scribes and Pharisees.[14] Summarized by Jesus into two \"Great Commandments\" that teach love of God and love of neighbor,[7] they instruct individuals on their relationships with both. The first three commandments require reverence and respect for God's name, observation of the Lord's Day and prohibit the worship of other gods. The others deal with the relationships between individuals, such as that between parent and child; they include prohibitions against lying, stealing, murdering, adultery and covetousness..\nPossible Next Actions: search[supreme court of india], search[moral majority]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[supreme court of india]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Supreme Court of India (ISO: Bh\u0101rata k\u0101 Sarv\u014dcca Ny\u0101y\u0101laya) is the supreme judicial authority and the highest court of the Republic of India.

By the time the television set had become a common part of home furnishing, sitcoms were significant expressions of everyday life and were often a window on the times of enormous social changes in the British class system and its conflicts and prejudices.[3] The period from 1970 to 1979 in particular is often considered the 'Golden Age' of British sitcom.[3] Since the turn of the century however, many are filmed on a single-camera set-up or entirely on location, with no studio screening or laugh track, such as The Royle Family (1998\u20132000, 2006\u20132012), and PhoneShop (2009\u20132013).[3].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for British sitcom provides a general background on the evolution of British sitcoms.

A libertine is especially someone who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour observed by the larger society.[1][2] The values and practices of libertines are known collectively as libertinism or libertinage and are described as an extreme form of hedonism or liberalism.[3] Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, Cyrano de Bergerac, and the Marquis de Sade.. The word libertine was originally coined by John Calvin to negatively describe opponents of his policies in Geneva, Switzerland.[4] The group, led by Ami Perrin, argued against Calvin's \"insistence that church discipline should be enforced uniformly against all members of Genevan society\".[5] Perrin and his allies were elected to the town council in 1548, and \"broadened their support base in Geneva by stirring up resentment among the older inhabitants against the increasing number of religious refugees who were fleeing France in even greater numbers\".[5] By 1555, Calvinists were firmly in place on the Genevan town council, so the Libertines, led by Perrin, responded with an \"attempted coup against the government and called for the massacre of the French.\nPossible Next Actions: search[assassins (musical)], search[libertine (disambiguation)], search[libertine (song)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[assassins (musical)]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Assassins is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by John Weidman, based on an original concept by Charles Gilbert Jr..

PSMF diets can last for up to 6 months, followed by a gradual increase in calories over 6\u20138 weeks.[2]. A PSMF attempts to spare the dieter the health risks of a complete fast by introducing the minimum amount of protein necessary to prevent muscle-wasting effects, while still eliminating fats and carbohydrates.[4]  Typically, depending on activity level, 0.8\u20131.2 g of protein per pound of lean body mass (not total body weight) is consumed. Protein beyond this minimum amount is also eliminated, as the body would use it for energy in a process called gluconeogenesis.[5] Further lean body mass (muscle, organs, etc.) are spared through resistance training and limiting aerobic activity.[6][7]. The concept of \"protein-sparing modified fast\" (PSMF) was described by George Blackburn in the early 1970s as an intensive weight-loss diet designed to mitigate the harms associated with protein-calorie malnutrition[8]  and nitrogen losses induced by either acute illness or hypocaloric diets in patients with obesity, in order to adapt\u00a0the patient's metabolism sufficiently to use endogenous fat stores as well as to preserve the protein contained in the body cell mass.[9][10].\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of people associated with the pontifical university of st. thomas aquinas]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[list of people associated with the pontifical university of st. thomas aquinas]\nObservation of Best Successor State: This is a partial list of alumni, faculty and staff associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome, Italy..

Medical imaging seeks to reveal internal structures hidden by the skin and bones, as well as to diagnose and treat disease. Medical imaging also establishes a database of normal anatomy and physiology to make it possible to identify abnormalities. Although imaging of removed organs and tissues can be performed for medical reasons, such procedures are usually considered part of pathology instead of medical imaging.[citation needed].

This process occurs near resonance, when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei, which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field, the chemical environment, and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca. 20\u00a0tesla, the frequency is similar to VHF and UHF television broadcasts (60\u20131000\u00a0MHz). NMR results from specific magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei. High-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study molecular physics and crystals as well as non-crystalline materials.\nPossible Next Actions: search[k-space in magnetic resonance imaging], search[safety of magnetic resonance imaging]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[safety of magnetic resonance imaging]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in general a safe technique, although injuries may occur as a result of failed safety procedures or human error.[1] During the last 150 years, thousands of papers focusing on the effects or side effects of magnetic or radiofrequency fields have been published. They can be categorized as incidental and physiological.[2] Contraindications to MRI include most cochlear implants and cardiac pacemakers, shrapnel and metallic foreign bodies in the eyes. The safety of MRI during the first trimester of pregnancy is uncertain, but it may be preferable to other options.[3] Since MRI does not use any ionizing radiation, its use generally is favored in preference to CT when either modality could yield the same information.[4] (In certain cases, MRI is not preferred as it may be more expensive, time-consuming and claustrophobia-exacerbating.). In an effort to standardize the roles and responsibilities of MRI professionals, an international consensus document, written and endorsed by major MRI and medical physics professional societies from around the globe, has been published formally.[5] The document outlines specific responsibilities for the following positions:.

The swastika (gammadion, fylfot) symbol became a popular symbol of luck in the Western world in the early 20th century, as it had long been in Asia, and was often used for ornamentation. The Nazi Party adopted the symbol in the 1920s,[5] and its use in Western countries faded after the Nazi association became dominant in the 1930s.[6] In recent decades many public swastikas have been removed or covered over, although some have been retained.

Red spruce is a perennial,[8] shade-tolerant, late successional[9] coniferous tree that under optimal conditions grows to 18\u201340\u00a0m (59\u2013131\u00a0ft) tall with a trunk diameter of about 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in), though exceptional specimens can reach 46\u00a0m (151\u00a0ft) tall and 100\u00a0cm (39 inches) in diameter. It has a narrow conical crown. The leaves are needle-like, yellow-green, 12\u201315\u00a0mm (15\u204432\u201319\u204432\u00a0in) long, four-sided, curved, with a sharp point, and extend from all sides of the twig.

However, from the previous action, we knew the plateau mostly resembles the vegetation of Adirondack Mountains and we can see that the native area of Red Spruce includes Adirondack Mountains. This indirect information can be considered a key step towards answering the question since we can infer the possible native area of Red Spruce that could be similar to the plateau.\nThus the correctness score is 6.20 / 10.00."}], [{"from": "human", "value": "Determine the value / correctness score (1 - 10) of the current state.\nYou must provide the best next action and the observation (in the same format as the current observation) for this best successor state.

In the year 1979, Corgan was twelve, and this is what he considered his transition into adolescence.[10]. \"1979\" reached number two in Canada and Iceland, number six in Ireland, number nine in New Zealand, and number 12 in the United States.\nPossible Next Actions: finish[mellon collie and the infinite sadness], search[adore (album)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[adore (album)]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Adore is the fourth studio album by the American alternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins, released on June 2, 1998, by Virgin Records. After the multi-platinum success of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and a subsequent world tour, Adore was considered \"one of the most anticipated albums of 1998\" by MTV.[1] Recording the album proved to be a challenge as the band members struggled with lingering interpersonal problems, musical uncertainty in the wake of three increasingly successful rock albums, and the departure of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin.[2] Frontman Billy Corgan would later characterize Adore as made by \"a band falling apart\".[3] Corgan was also going through a divorce and the death of his mother while recording the album.[4]. The result was a much more subdued and electronica-tinged sound that Greg Kot of Rolling Stone magazine called \"a complete break with the past\".[5] The album divided the Smashing Pumpkins fan base and was not as commercially successful as their previous two albums. However, similar to the band's other releases across the decade, the album was critically acclaimed, with praise directed at Corgan's vocal performance, Iha's more subtle guitar work, atmospheric sound, and more mature songwriting..

Although a small number of castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringwork castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone \u2013 with characteristic square keep \u2013 that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by the Norman lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom.\nPossible Next Actions: search[ireland], search[castles in scotland]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[castles in scotland]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Castles are buildings that combine fortifications and residence, and many were built within the borders of modern Scotland.

Reverse discrimination based on race or ethnicity is also called reverse racism.[1]. Philosopher Richard Arneson argues that while a program of reverse discrimination favoring non-White candidates over White ones may violate equality of opportunity in a formal sense, it may more effectively promote substantive equality.[2] The Dilemma of difference refers to the difference between the two equality concepts.[3]. Affirmative action is a set of practices that attempts to promote diversity in areas such as employment, education, and leadership, typically by reserving some positions for people of traditionally disadvantaged groups. This may result in discrimination towards successful majority groups who have greater technical qualifications than minority applicants.[4].\nPossible Next Actions: search[affirmative action]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[affirmative action]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Affirmative action (also sometimes called reservations, alternative access, positive discrimination or positive action in various countries' laws and policies)[a] refers to a set of policies and practices within a government or organization seeking to address systemic discrimination. Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has been justified by the idea that it may help with bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, and promoting diversity, social equity, and social inclusion and redressing alleged wrongs, harms, or hindrances, also called substantive equality.[8]. The nature of affirmative-action policies varies from region to region and exists on a spectrum from a hard quota to merely targeting encouragement for increased participation. Some countries use a quota system, reserving a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies for members of a certain group; an example of this is the reservation system in India.

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and institutions in all parts of the world, including some, where such discrimination is generally decried. In some places, countervailing measures such as quotas have been used to redress the balance in favor of those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. These attempts have often been met with controversy, and sometimes been called reverse discrimination..

Anti-discrimination law may include protections for groups based on sex, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, mental illness or ability, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity/expression, sex characteristics, religion, creed, or individual political opinions.. Anti-discrimination laws are rooted in principles of equality, specifically, that individuals should not be treated differently due to the characteristics outlined above.[4][5] At the same time, they have often been criticised as violations of the inherent right of free association. Anti-discrimination laws are designed to protect against both individual discrimination (committed by individuals) and from structural discrimination (arising from policies or procedures that disadvantage certain groups).[6] Courts may take into account both discriminatory intent and disparate impact in determining whether a particular action or policy constitutes discrimination.[7]. Equality and freedom from discrimination are outlines as basic human rights by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).[8] While the UDHR is not binding, nations make a commitment to uphold those rights through the ratification of international human rights treaties.[9] Specific treaties relevant to anti-discrimination law include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.[10] In addition, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 and Goal 16 also advocates for international efforts towards eliminating discriminatory laws.[11].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for anti-discrimination law provides information on laws that prevent discrimination in employment, housing, education, and other areas of social life, including protecting groups based on multiple characteristics, which is a key step towards answering the question, as we can next relate it to Black Economic Empowerment and understand its sibling policy of favoring those who suffer from discrimination.\nThus the correctness score is 5.75 / 10.00."}], [{"from": "human", "value": "Determine the value / correctness score (1 - 10) of the current state.\nYou must provide the best next action and the observation (in the same format as the current observation) for this best successor state.

As of 2024, affirmative action rhetoric has been increasingly replaced by emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion and nine states explicitly ban its use in the employment process.[10][11]  The Supreme Court in 2023 explicitly rejected race-based affirmative action in college admissions in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. The Court held that affirmative action programs \"lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

Chelone is notable for her transformation myth into a tortoise, an animal that lives in the shell it constantly carries, after refusing to leave her house to attend Zeus' wedding. The myth is known through the works of several authors, including Aesop, and probably originated from one of his fables.. The noun \u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7 is the ancient Greek word for both the land tortoise and the sea turtle.[1] Traditionally the word is considered to derive from an Indo-European root *g\u02b0el(H)-ewH- denoting turtles and tortoises, however it has also been suggested that it must be a loanword from a non-Indo-European language, a theory that Beekes supports.[2]. According to Servius, the myth goes that when all the gods, men, and animals were invited by the divine messenger Hermes to attend the wedding of the king and queen of the gods, Zeus and Hera, the river-dwelling nymph Chelone alone remained at home, to show her disregard of the solemnity.[3][4] But Hermes then descended from Mount Olympus, threw Chelone's house, which stood on the bank of a river, together with the nymph,[5] into the water and transformed her into a lazy tortoise, who had henceforth to carry her house on her back.[6][7] The Vatican Mythographers recorded the same version.[8].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for Chelone provides the information that Chelone is a genus from Greek mythology.

The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman and their bizarre adventures in and around the fictional Colorado town of South Park.[1]  The town is also home to an assortment of characters who make frequent appearances in the show, such as students and their family members, elementary school staff, and recurring characters.[1]. Stan is portrayed as the everyman of the group,[2] as the show's official website describes him as \"a normal, average, American, mixed-up kid.\"[3] Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically.[2] Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is intended to reflect the real-life friendship between South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone,[4] is a common topic throughout the series. Cartman\u2014loud, obnoxious, and obese\u2014is sometimes portrayed as the series' antihero[5] and his antisemitic attitude has resulted in an ever-progressing rivalry with Kyle.[2] Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most of his face and muffles his speech. During the show's first five seasons, Kenny died in almost every single episode before returning in the next without explanation..\nPossible Next Actions: search[subject matter in south park], search[butters' very own episode], search[south park episodes], search[south park: the end of obesity]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[subject matter in south park]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The American animated sitcom South Park has covered and satirized a large number of topics over the course of its run.

Unlike bowl games, classics take place during college football's regular season; they differ from standard regular season games in that they are often accompanied by entertaining battle of the bands, parades, tailgate parties, social events, concerts, job fairs, and are often played at touristic neutral sites. Football classics annually attract large crowds of alumni, fans, and spectators in general, along with high media interest and corporate sponsorships.[1]. Special games pairing HBCUs have existed since at least 1915 when Wiley University played Homer College in a Louisiana State Fair-sponsored game[2] (most recently called the \"Red River State Fair Classic\") in Shreveport, Louisiana. The earliest known use of the term \"classic\" to informally describe a black college football game occurred in 1919 on Thanksgiving Day, for a game between Howard and Lincoln (PA).[3] The earliest documented use of \"classic\" as part of an annual black college football game's formal name dates to the Thanksgiving, 1921 \"Colored Foot Ball Classic,\" played in Philadelphia between Howard and Lincoln (PA).[4].\nPossible Next Actions: search[2007 tuskegee golden tigers football team], search[african americans in atlanta], search[mercedes-benz stadium], search[auburn, alabama], search[1941 tuskegee golden tigers football team]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[mercedes-benz stadium]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Mercedes-Benz Stadium is a retractable roof multi-purpose stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.[15] Opened in 2017 as a replacement for the Georgia Dome, it is the home of the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL) and Atlanta United FC of Major League Soccer (MLS).

During the Reconstruction era, most historically black colleges were founded by Protestant religious organizations. This changed in 1890 with the U.S. Congress' passage of the Second Morrill Act, which required segregated Southern states to provide African Americans with public higher-education schools in order to receive the Act's benefits. During the 19th century, either after expanding their inclusion of black people and African Americans into their institutions or gaining the status of minority-serving institution, became predominantly black institutions (PBIs).[5].\nPossible Next Actions: search[morehouse college], search[list of historically black colleges and universities], search[black mecca]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[morehouse college]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Morehouse College is a private, historically black, men's liberal arts college in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

This era of massive migration and settlement was particularly encouraged by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase, giving rise to the expansionist attitude known as \"manifest destiny\" and historians' \"Frontier Thesis\". The legends, historical events and folklore of the American frontier, known as the frontier myth, have embedded themselves into United States culture so much so that the Old West, and the Western genre of media specifically, has become one of the defining features of American national identity.[8]. Historians have debated at length as to when the frontier era began, when it ended, and which were its key sub-periods.[3] For example, the Old West subperiod is sometimes used by historians regarding the time from the end of the American Civil War in 1865 to when the Superintendent of the Census, William Rush Merriam, stated the U.S. Census Bureau would stop recording western frontier settlement as part of its census categories after the 1890 U.S.\nPossible Next Actions: search[meridian, mississippi], search[opera in the united states], search[music of mississippi]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[music of mississippi]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Mississippi is best known as the home of the blues which developed among the freed African Americans in the latter half of the 19th century and beginning 20th century.

Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.[1] The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.[2] The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy; the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood in the Compromise of 1850. The gold rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation, and the California genocide.. The effects of the gold rush were substantial. Whole indigenous societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers, called \"forty-niners\" (referring to 1849, the peak year for gold rush immigration).\nPossible Next Actions: search[list of mines in california], search[new idria mercury mine], search[list of people who died in traffic collisions]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[new idria mercury mine]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The New Idria Mercury Mine encompasses 8,000 acres of land in the Diablo Mountain range, incorporating the town of Idria in San Benito County, California.

The film follows silver miner-turned-oilman Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) as he embarks on a ruthless quest for wealth during the Californian oil boom between the late 19th and early 20th centuries.. Development on There Will Be Blood began after writer Eric Schlosser purchased the film rights to Sinclair's novel in 2004: it was acquired by Ghoulardi Film Company, Paramount Vantage and Miramax Films after Anderson completed the first draft of the film's screenplay. Day-Lewis immediately joined the project while Dano, who initially signed on for a smaller role, took on a starring role after replacing Kel O'Neill during filming.\nPossible Next Actions: search[paul thomas anderson], search[paul w. s. anderson], finish[there will be blood]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: finish[there will be blood]\nObservation of Best Successor State: Terminal State\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The answer is directly supported by the information that the film \"There Will Be Blood\" was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.

The best-known version is the one collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1837 in the third edition of their collection Grimm's Fairy Tales (KHM 161).[1] It was first published by Wilhelm Grimm in 1827 in Wilhelm Hauff's M\u00e4rchen-Almanach.[2] An older, somewhat shorter version, \"The Ungrateful Dwarf\", was written by Caroline Stahl (1776\u20131837). Indeed, that appears to be the oldest variant; no previous oral version is known, although several have been collected since its publication in 1818.[3] Oral versions are very limited regionally.[4] The tale is of Aarne\u2013Thompson type 426 (\"The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf\").[1]. Despite the presence of one dwarf, this story is not related to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Snow White\" that provided the basis for the 1937 Walt Disney animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Liberal arts education can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course or to a university education more generally. Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses.[3]. The term liberal arts for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, mostly expanding it.

One of the first explicit classifications of a \"Philippine\" grouping based on genetic affiliation was in 1906 by Frank Blake, who placed them as a subdivision of the \"Malay branch\" within Malayo-Polynesian (MP), which at that time was considered as a family. Blake however encompasses every language within the geographic boundaries of the Philippine archipelago to be under a single group.[6] Formal arguments in support of a specific \"Proto-Philippines\" were followed by Matthew Charles in 1974, Teodoro Llamzon in 1966 and 1975, and Llamzon and Teresita Martin in 1976.[7][8][9][10] Blust (1991) two decades later updates this based on Zorc's (1986) inclusion of Yami, and the Sangiric, Minahasan, and Gorontalo groups.[6]. The genetic unity of a Philippines group has been rejected particularly by Lawrence Reid.[11] This arose with problems in reconstructing Philippine subgroups within MP (Pawley, 1999; Ross, 2005).[12][13] In a recent state-of-the art on the classification of Philippine languages, he provides multidisciplinary arguments on the field's methodological and theoretical shortcomings since Conant's description in the early 1900s.\nPossible Next Actions: search[41st golden globe awards], search[television shows], search[the voice (american tv series)]"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I will evaluate the best successor state from the current state:\nBest Next Action: search[the voice (american tv series)]\nObservation of Best Successor State: The Voice is an American singing reality competition television series that premiered on NBC on April 26, 2011.

While some Black immigrants or their children may also come to identify as African American, the majority of first-generation immigrants do not, preferring to identify with their nation of origin.[8][9] Most African Americans are of West African and coastal Central African ancestry, with varying amounts of Western European and Native American ancestry.[10]. African-American history began in the 16th century, with Africans from West Africa and coastal Central Africa being sold to European slave traders and transported across the Atlantic to the Western Hemisphere. After arriving in the Americas, they were sold as slaves to European colonists and put to work on plantations, particularly in the southern colonies.

Its slogan, \"Red Bull Gives You Wings\",[12] is considered one of the most popular and memorable advertising slogans in the world.[13] Rather than following a traditional marketing approach, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a \"brand myth\"[14][15] through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and standout stunts such as the Stratos space diving project.[16] In addition to sport series, its marketing includes multiple sports team ownerships; celebrity endorsements; and music, through its Red Bull Records label.[17]. Red Bull was derived from a similar drink called Krating Daeng which originated in Thailand and was introduced by the pharmacist Chaleo Yoovidhya.\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for Red Bull provides the information that the company owns a licensed brand that seeks to engage the private sector in raising awareness and funds to help eliminate HIV/AIDS in various regions, but it lacks specific information about their partner. Since the information provided by the search results is still a background level to answering the question, the contribution to answering the question is a small step.\nSince the question specifically asks about a Dutch sports and clothing company, which is not found in the results, this contributes to considering that searching other entities could potentially yield a better answer. However, as this information provides the model with possible tracks to follow, the information contained still contributes halfway by providing the search possible tracks to follow.\nThus the correctness score is 4.00 / 10.00."}], [{"from": "human", "value": "Determine the value / correctness score (1 - 10) of the current state.\nYou must provide the best next action and the observation (in the same format as the current observation) for this best successor state.

Reasons for such slips include the lack of understanding of the language, culture and consumer attitudes in the new market.. There are numerous examples of brand blunders in marketing history; there are also numerous urban legends surrounding brand blunders, where there is little evidence of an actual blunder.. Problems with international product branding are often associated with the process of language localisation, in which the product brand name or advertising slogan carries a different meaning in the language of the target market.[1] In addition to linguistic aspects, issues of cultural sensitivity can affect the success of a brand..

Between 1986 and 2024 Avert supported inclusive, non-judgemental information services, sponsored medical research that others refused to fund, and supported local organisations in the UK, Asia and Africa with funds to support key HIV prevention, care and treatment services.. During its last ten years, Avert focused primarily on digital communications to build health literacy on HIV and sexual health, thereby supporting global efforts to end AIDS and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal for Health.. In this period, Avert worked in partnership with organisations in countries most affected by HIV to develop and promote digital HIV and sexual health content and resources that are accurate, accessible, useful, and actionable.. In November 2023, work began to transition Avert\u2019s core brands to African-led and African-based organisations who could maintain and grow Avert\u2019s legacy into the future..\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action that searching for Avert a HIV and AIDS organisation, provides some background information about Avert. This information is slightly relevant to the question since a potential partner brand is mentioned, but it doesn't directly answer who the Dutch sports and clothing company is.

Researchers estimate that some time in the early 20th century, a form of Simian immunodeficiency virus found in chimpanzees (SIVcpz) first entered humans in Central Africa and began circulating in L\u00e9opoldville (modern-day Kinshasa) by the 1920s.[1][2][3] This gave rise to the pandemic form of HIV (HIV-1 group M); other zoonotic transmissions led to the other, less prevalent, subtypes of HIV.[3][4].

Although the continent constitutes about 17% of the world's population,[1] it bears a disproportionate burden of the epidemic. As of 2023, around 25.6 million people in sub-Saharan Africa were living with HIV, accounting for over two-thirds of the global total.[2] The majority of new infections and AIDS-related deaths occur in Eastern and Southern Africa, which house approximately 55% of the global HIV-positive population.[3]. In regions such as Southern Africa, the epidemic is particularly severe. Countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Zambia, and Zimbabwe exhibit adult prevalence rates exceeding 10%.[4] This has significantly affected life expectancy, with reductions of up to 20 years in the most impacted areas.[5] By contrast, North Africa, West Africa, and the Horn of Africa report significantly lower prevalence rates, attributed to differing cultural practices and reduced engagement in high-risk behaviors.[6].\nReflection of the Best Successor State: The LAST action of searching for HIV/AIDS in Africa provides information about the regions and countries affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa, but it does not directly answer the question of who owns a licensed brand. This information is at the background level to answering the question, as it does not provide a clear direction towards finding the owner of the licensed brand. More importantly, the fact that it does not provide the name of the owner makes it less relevant to answering the question.\nThus the correctness score is 3.00 / 10.00."}]]
